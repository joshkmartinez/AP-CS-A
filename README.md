# AP CS A Online Edhesive Class
for the **online Edhesive course** & **Fall 2018: P209B16 - AP Computer Science A (Java)**
**I used a ton of different IDE's throughout the course, just look for the _.java_ file**  (I used mainly bluej and drjava)
  
I also have the drjava program in the repo, just install java and run _drjava.jar_ file  
***your welcome, star this repo if you want***
