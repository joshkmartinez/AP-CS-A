# AP Computer Science A Online Edhesive Class
This repo is for the **online Edhesive course** & the **Fall 2018: P209B16 - AP Computer Science A (Java)** class  
  
**I used a ton of different IDE's throughout the course, just look for the _.java_ files** (I used mainly bluej and drjava)  
  
I also have the drjava program in the repo, just install java and run _drjava.jar_ file  
  
***hehe***
