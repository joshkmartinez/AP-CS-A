/*
 * Lesson 13 Coding Activity 6 
 * We are going to redo the last coding activity from Lesson 12,
 * but this time it will also print out a message if the temperature is OK.
 * 
 * You are running an experiment that involves hatching chicken eggs.
 * Bird eggs are very sensitive to temperature and chickens' eggs will hatch between 99 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit.
 *
 * Write the code for the sensor that will be tracking the temperature. 
 * If the temperature falls below 99 or above 102 your code should print ÒWARNINGÓ otherwise ÒTemperature is OKÓ.
 * The values 99 and 102 are considered to be included in the ok range and the input will be in doubles.
 *
 * 
 *     Sample Run 1
 *         What is the temperature?
 *         45.3
 *         WARNING
 *
 *         
 *      Sample Run 2
 *         What is the temperature?
 *         100    
 *         Temperature is OK
 *
