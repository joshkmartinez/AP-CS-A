 * Lesson 29 Coding Activity 2
 * Write a loop that processes an array of strings. 
 * Each String should be printed backwards on its own line.
 * 
 * For example, if the list contains:
 *     
 *     {"every", "nearing", "checking", "food", "stand", "value"}
 * 
 * It should output:
 *     yreve
 *     gniraen
 *     gnikcehc
 *     doof
 *     dnats
 *     eulav
