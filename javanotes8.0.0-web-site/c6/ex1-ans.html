<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 6.1</h2>

<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.1:</h3>
<p>In <a href="../c6/s3.html#GUI1.3.2">Subsection&nbsp;6.3.2</a>, the following code was
given as an example.  It installs a <span class="code">MousePressed</span> event handler
on a canvas.  The handler lets the user draw a red rectangle at the point
where the user clicks the mouse, or, by holding the shift key down,
a blue oval:</p>

<pre>canvas.setOnMousePressed( evt -&gt; {
    GraphicsContext g = canvas.getGraphicsContext2D();
    if ( evt.isShiftDown() ) {
        g.setFill( Color.BLUE );
        g.fillOval( evt.getX() - 30, evt.getY() - 15, 60, 30 )
    }
    else {
        g.setFill( Color.RED );
        g.fillRect( evt.getX() - 30, evt.getY() - 15, 60, 30 );
    }
} );</pre>

<p>Write a complete program that does the same, but in addition, the program
will continue to draw figures if the user drags the mouse.  
That is, the mouse will leave a trail of figures as the user
drags.  However, if the user right-clicks the canvas, then the canvas should simply be
cleared and no figures should be drawn even if the user drags the mouse after
right-clicking. See the discussion of dragging in <a href="../c6/s3.html#GUI1.3.3">Subsection&nbsp;6.3.3</a>.
Here is a picture of my solution:</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="simple-stamper-with-drag.png" width="400" height="305" alt="the program showing trails of ovals and rects"></p>

<p>Note that a black border has been added around each shape to make them more distinct.</p>

<p>To make the problem a little more challenging, when drawing shapes
during a drag operation, make sure that the shapes that are drawn are at least, say,
5 pixels apart.  To implement this, you have to keep track of the position where the
previous shape was drawn.</p>

<p>In order to implement dragging, we need to add a handler
for <span class="code">MouseDragged</span> events, in addition to the handler for <span class="code">MousePressed</span> events.
Since the code for handling the events is rather long, I wrote separate methods to handle
the events, and the event handlers that I register with the canvas simply call
those methods:</p>


<pre>canvas.setOnMousePressed( e -&gt; mousePressed(e) );
canvas.setOnMouseDragged( e -&gt; mouseDragged(e) );</pre>


<p>I also decided to use a global variable, <span class="code">canvasGraphics</span>,
of type <span class="classname">GraphicsContext</span> to represent the graphics
context for drawing on the canvas.  I get the graphics context in the
<span class="code">start()</span> method when I create the canvas, 
and I fill the canvas with white:</p>


<pre>Canvas canvas = new Canvas(500,380);
canvasGraphics = canvas.getGraphicsContext2D();
canvasGraphics.setFill(Color.WHITE);
canvasGraphics.fillRect(0,0,500,380);
canvasGraphics.setStroke(Color.BLACK); // stroke color never changes</pre>


<p>I wanted to have a black border around the canvas (more for the screenshot
than for anything else).  I could have drawn the border on the canvas itself,
but I decided to apply the border to the pane that is used as the root of
the scene graph.  This led me to use a <span class="classname">BorderPane</span>
for the root rather than a simple <span class="classname">Pane</span>.  When a <span class="classname">BorderPane</span>
computes its preferred size, it allows space for any border or padding that have been applied
to the pane, and the content is correctly placed inside the border and padding.  A
<span class="classname">Pane</span> would not take care of that for me.  (When I first 
wrote the program, using a <span class="classname">Pane</span>, the canvas covered part of
the border.)  So, the root pane is created with</p>


<pre>BorderPane root = new BorderPane(canvas);
root.setStyle("-fx-border-color: black; -fx-border-width: 2px");</pre>


<p>The <span class="code">mousePressed()</span> method can use the code given in the
exercise, except that the graphics context is named <span class="code">canvasGraphics</span>
instead of <span class="code">g</span>, and code should be added to stroke the shapes with black
after filling them.
However, before drawing anything, the method must check
whether the user right-clicked the canvas; if so, the canvas should be
cleared and nothing should be drawn.  The test that is needed is
if <span class="code">evt.getButton() == MouseButton.SECONDARY</span>.
</p>


<p>Furthermore, we need to add some global variables to the program to
keep track of what is happening as the user drags the mouse.
First of all, <span class="code">mouseDragged()</span> does not always
draw shapes; if the user used the right mouse button, no shapes are
drawn.  We can implement that with the typical <span class="ptype">boolean</span> instance
variable, <span class="code">dragging</span>.  This variable is set to <span class="code">false</span>
in <span class="code">mousePressed()</span> if the user right-clicked, and it is set
to <span class="code">true</span> otherwise.  If <span class="code">dragging</span> is false
in <span class="code">mouseDragged()</span>, then that method returns without
drawing anything.</p>


<p>In addition, even when <span class="code">dragging</span> is <span class="code">true</span>,
<span class="code">mouseDragged()</span> should not draw anything unless the mouse
has moved at least 5 pixels since the previous shape was drawn.
We need two more global variables, of type <span class="ptype">double</span>,
to keep track of the mouse position where a shape was most recently
drawn.  In my program, the variables are <span class="code">prevShapeX</span> and <span class="code">prevShapeY</span>.
The variables' values should be set every time a shape is drawn,
in either <span class="code">mousePressed()</span> or <span class="code">mouseDragged()</span>,
and <span class="code">mouseDragged()</span> should compare their values to the
current mouse location to decide whether the mouse has moved far
enough to draw the next shape.  It is not completely clear what  "move at least 5 pixels" 
means, but I take it to
mean "move at least 5 pixels vertically or at least 5 pixels horizontally".
So, <span class="code">mouseDragged()</span> starts off like this:</p>


<pre>public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent evt) {
    if ( dragging == false ) { 
        return;
    }
    
    double x = evt.getX();  // x-coordinate where user clicked.
    double y = evt.getY();  // y-coordinate where user clicked.
    
    if ( Math.abs(x - prevShapeX) &lt; 5 &amp;&amp; Math.abs(y - prevShapeY) &lt; 5 ) {
            // The mouse has not moved at least 5 pixels horizontally
            // or vertically, so don't draw another shape yet.
        return;
    }
    
    prevShapeX = x;  // Save coords where the next shape is being drawn.
    prevShapeY = y;</pre>
