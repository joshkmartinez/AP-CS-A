<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.2:</h3>
<p>Write a program that shows a small red square and a small blue
square. The user should be able to drag either square with the mouse.
(You'll need an instance variable to remember which square the user is
dragging.) The user can drag the square out of the window if she wants, and it will
disappear.  To allow the user to get the squares back into the window,
add a <span class="code">KeyPressed</span> event handler that will restore the
squares to their original positions when the user presses the Escape key.
The key code for the Escape key is <span class="code">KeyCode.ESCAPE</span>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Since the squares can move, the program needs global
variables to keep track of the current location of each square.  I do that
with instance variables <span class="code">x1</span> and
<span class="code">y1</span> for the upper left corner of the red square and <span class="code">x2</span> and
<span class="code">y2</span> for the upper left corner of the blue square.  These variables
are of type <span class="ptype">double</span> since mouse positions are given as real
numbers in JavaFX.  The canvas is also a global variable.
I wrote a method, <span class="code">draw()</span>,
to completely redraw the content of the canvas.  It is called in the <span class="code">start()</span> method
and whenever one of the squares is moved.  The <span class="code">draw()</span> method can get
the graphics context that it needs to do its drawing from the canvas:</p>


<pre>private void draw() {
    GraphicsContext g = canvas.getGraphicsContext2D();
    g.setFill(Color.rgb(230,255,230)); // light green
    g.fillRect(0,0,canvas.getWidth(),canvas.getHeight());
    g.setFill(Color.RED);
    g.fillRect(x1, y1, 30, 30);
    g.setFill(Color.BLUE);
    g.fillRect(x2, y2, 30, 30);
}</pre>


<p>To implement dragging, the program needs event handlers for
<span class="code">MousePressed</span>, <span class="code">MouseDragged</span>, and (maybe) <span class="code">MouseReleased</span>
events.  The handlers need to be added to the canvas that fills the window.
My event handlers simply call methods such as <span class="code">mousePressed(evt)</span> that
are defined elsewhere in the program.</p>

<p>For this simple application of dragging, the program doesn't need to keep
track of the previous or starting positions of the mouse.
But as usual for dragging, I use a boolean variable,
<span class="code">dragging</span>, to keep track of whether or not a drag operation is in
progress. Not every mouse press starts a drag operation. If the user clicks the
canvas outside of the squares, there is nothing to drag, and so <span class="code">dragging</span>
is set to false in the <span class="code">mousePressed</span> method.  If the user clicks one 
of the squares, <span class="code">dragging</span> is set to true. Since there are two
squares to be dragged, we have to keep track of which is being dragged. I use a
boolean variable, <span class="code">dragRedSquare</span>, which is true if the red square is
being dragged and is false if the blue square is being dragged. (A boolean
variable is actually not the best choice in this case. It would be a problem if
we wanted to add another square. A boolean variable only has two possible
values, so an integer variable would probably be a better choice.  Better yet,
the rectangles could be represented by objects, and a the global variable would
refer to the object that is being dragged, or would be <span class="code">null</span> when
no object is being dragged.) </p>


<p>There is one little problem. The mouse location is a single <span class="code">(x,y)</span>
point. A square occupies a whole bunch of points. When we move the square to
follow the mouse, where exactly should we put the square? One possibility is to
put the upper left corner of the square at the mouse location. If we did this,
the <span class="code">mouseDragged</span> routine would look like:</p>


<pre>public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent evt) { 
    if (dragging == false)  
      return;
    double x = evt.getX();  // Get mouse position.
    double y = evt.getY();
    if (dragRedSquare) {  // Move the red square.
       x1 = x;  // Put top-left corner at mouse position.
       y1 = y;
    }
    else {   // Move the blue square.
       x2 = x;  // Put top-left corner at mouse position.
       y2 = y;
    }
    draw();  // redraw canvas with square in new location
}</pre>


<p>This works, but it is not very aesthetic. When the user starts dragging a
square, no matter where in the square the user clicks, the square will jump so
that its top-left corner is at the mouse position. This is not what a user
typically expects. If I grab a square by clicking its center, then I want the
center to stay under the mouse cursor as I move it. If I grab the lower right
corner, I want the lower right corner to follow the mouse, not the upper left
corner. There is a solution to this, and it's one that is often needed for
dragging operations. We need to record the original position of the mouse
relative to the upper left corner of the square. This tells us where in the
square the user clicked. This is done in the <span class="code">mousePressed()</span> method by
assigning appropriate values to two new instance variables <span class="code">offsetX</span> and
<span class="code">offsetY</span>:</p>


<pre>double x = evt.getX();  // Location where user clicked.
double y = evt.getY();

if (x &gt;= x2 &amp;&amp; x &lt; x2+30 &amp;&amp; y &gt;= y2 &amp;&amp; y &lt; y2+30) {
      // It's the blue square (which should be checked first,
      // since it's drawn on top of the red square.)
   dragging = true;
   dragRedSquare = false;
   offsetX = x - x2;  // Distance from corner of square to (x,y).
   offsetY = y - y2;
}
else if (x &gt;= x1 &amp;&amp; x &lt; x1+30 &amp;&amp; y &gt;= y1 &amp;&amp; y &lt; y1+30) {
      // It's the red square.
   dragging = true;
   dragRedSquare = true;
   offsetX = x - x1;  // Distance from corner of square to (x,y).
   offsetY = y - y1;
}</pre>


<p>In <span class="code">mouseDragged()</span>, when the mouse moves to a new <span class="code">(x,y)</span>
point, we move the square so that the vertical and horizontal distances between
the mouse location and the top left corner of the square remain the same,
as given by <span class="code">offsetX</span> and <span class="code">offsetY</span>:</p>


<pre>if (dragRedSquare) {  // Move the red square.
   x1 = x - offsetX;  // Offset corner from mouse location.
   y1 = y - offsetY;
}
else {   // Move the blue square.
   x2 = x - offsetX;  // Offset corner from mouse location.
   y2 = y - offsetY;
}</pre>


<p>By the way, if you wanted to stop the user from dragging the square outside
the window, you would just have to add code to the <span class="code">mouseDragged</span>
routine to "clamp" the variables <span class="code">x1</span>, <span class="code">y1</span>, <span class="code">x2</span>, and
<span class="code">y2</span> so that they lie in the acceptable range. Here is a modified
routine that keeps the square entirely within the canvas:</p>


<pre>public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent evt) { 
    if (dragging == false)  
      return;
    double x = evt.getX();
    double y = evt.getY();
    if (dragRedSquare) {  // Move the red square.
       x1 = x - offsetX;
       y1 = y - offsetY;
       if (x1 &lt; 0)  // Clamp (x1,y1) so the square lies in the canvas.
          x1 = 0;
       else if (x1 &gt;= canvas.getWidth() - 30)
          x1 = canvas.getWidth() - 30;
       if (y1 &lt; 0)
          y1 = 0;
       else if (y1 &gt;= canvas.getHeight() - 30)
          y1 = canvas.getHeight() - 30;
    }
    else {   // Move the blue square.
       x2 = x - offsetX;
       y2 = y - offsetY;
       if (x2 &lt; 0)  // Clamp (x2,y2) so the square lies in the canvas.
          x2 = 0;
       else if (x2 &gt;= canvas.getWidth() - 30)
          x2 = canvas.getWidth() - 30;
       if (y2 &lt; 0)
          y2 = 0;
       else if (y2 &gt;= canvas.getHeight() - 30)
          y2 = canvas.getHeight() - 30;
    }
    draw();
}</pre>

<p>Finally, we need to program a response to the Escape key.
As discussed in <a href="../c6/s3.html#GUI1.3.4">Subsection&nbsp;6.3.4</a>, we can register the
<span class="code">KeyPressed</span> event handler with the scene.  The handler
simply has to reset the variables <span class="code">x1</span>, <span class="code">y1</span>,
<span class="code">x2</span>, and <span class="code">y2</span> to their original values
and redraw the canvas.  I define the handler in the <span class="code">start()</span>
method after creating the <span class="code">scene</span>:</p>


<pre>Scene scene = new Scene(root);
scene.setOnKeyPressed( e -&gt; {
       // If user pressed ESCAPE, move squares
       // back to starting positions, and redraw.
    if ( e.getCode() == KeyCode.ESCAPE ) {
        x1 = 10;
        y1 = 10;
        x2 = 50;
        y2 = 10;
        draw();
    }
});</pre>
