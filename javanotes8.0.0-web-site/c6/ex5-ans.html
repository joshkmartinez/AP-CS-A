<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.5:</h3>
<p>In <a href="../c3/ex8-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;3.8</a>, you drew a checkerboard. For this
exercise, write a program where the user can select a square by
clicking on it.
Highlight the selected square by drawing a colored border around
it. When the program starts, no square is selected. When the user
clicks on a square that is not currently selected, it becomes selected, and the
previously selected square, if any, is unselected. If the
user clicks the square that is selected, it becomes unselected. Assume that the
size of the checkerboard is exactly 400 by 400 pixels, so that each square on the
checkerboard is 50 by 50 pixels.  Here is my checkerboard, with the square in
row 3, column 3 selected, shown at reduced size:</p>

<hr>
<p>See the solution to <a href="../c3/ex8-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;3.8</a> for
a discussion of how to draw the checkerboard. For the new version, we need
to add a <span class="code">MousePressed</span> event handler to the <span class="classname">Canvas</span>
on which the checkerboard is drawn. We also need to add instance variables to
keep track of which square, if any, is selected.  I use two integer variables
<span class="code">selectedRow</span> and <span class="code">selectedCol</span>.
When no square is selected, <span class="code">selectedRow</span> is -1 (and I don't care what
<span class="code">selectedCol</span> is). When a square is selected, <span class="code">selectedRow</span> is
the number of the row that contains that square and <span class="code">selectedCol</span> is the
number of the column that contains the selected square. Remember that rows and
columns are numbered from 0 to 7. This makes some of the calculations easier
than numbering them from 1 to 8.</p>


<p>After drawing the checkerboard, <span class="code">draw()</span>, the method that draws the canvas,
has to highlight the selected square, if there is one. I do
this by drawing a cyan border around the inside of the selected square. This is
the new code that is added to the checkerboard-drawing code, after the
checkerboard has been drawn:</p>


<pre>if (selectedRow &gt;= 0) {
        // Since there is a selected square, draw a cyan
        // border around it.  (If selectedRow &lt; 0, then
        // no square is selected and no border is drawn.)
    g.setStroke(Color.CYAN);
    g.setLineWidth(3);  // the border will be 3 pixels wide
    y = selectedRow * 50;  // y-coord of top-left corner of selected square
    x = selectedCol * 50;  // x-coord of top-left corner of selected square
    g.strokeRect(x+1.5, y+1.5, 47, 47);
}</pre>


<p>The border of the selected square is three pixels wide. To make the border lie
entirely inside the square, we need to stroke a rectangle that is inset from
the edges of the square by half of the line width, that is, by 1.5 pixels.
This explains the parameters to <span class="code">g.strokeRect()</span>.  Remember that
when a shape is stroked, the center of the pen is dragged along the border
of the shape.</p>


<p>Now, let's say that the user clicks at the point <span class="code">(x,y)</span>. The problem is
to determine which square on the checkerboard contains that point. The column
number of the square is obtained by dividing the <span class="code">x</span> coordinate by the
width of the squares. The column number is an integer, while <span class="code">x</span>
is of type <span class="ptype">double</span>.  Since the squares are 50 pixels wide, the row number of
the clicked square is <span class="code">(int)(x/50)</span>. 
For values of <span class="code">x</span> between 0 and 49, <span class="code">x/50</span> is greater than or equal
to 0 and less than 1, so taking its integer part
gives a column number of 0, which is correct. For the next 50 pixels, from
50 to 99, <span class="code">(int)(x/50)</span> is 1, which is the correct column number. For the next
strip of pixels, from 100 to 149, the answer is 2. And so on. Similarly,
<span class="code">(int)(y/50)</span> gives the row number of the square where the user clicked.
(I often get rows and columns mixed up&mdash;remember that the x coordinate corresponds to
columns and the y coordinate corresponds to rows.)</p>


<p>Once we know the row and column where the user clicked, we can compare them
to <span class="code">selectedRow</span> and <span class="code">selectedCol</span>. If the values are the same,
then the user clicked in a square that was already selected. We want to remove
the highlighting. That can be done by setting <span class="code">selectedRow = -1</span>, the value
that indicates that no square is selected. Otherwise, the values of
<span class="code">selectedRow</span> and <span class="code">selectedCol</span> are set to the row and column
that the user clicked.  In the end, <span class="code">draw()</span> is called so that the
change will be reflected in what is shown on the screen.</p>


<p>All this explains the reasoning behind the <span class="code">mousePressed()</span> routine,
which you can see below.</p>
