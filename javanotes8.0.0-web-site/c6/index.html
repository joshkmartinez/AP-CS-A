<hr class="break">

<p>
<span class="start"><big>C</big>omputer users today expect</span> to interact
with their computers using a graphical user interface (GUI), and
Java can be used to write sophisticated GUI programs.</p>
   

<p>GUI programs
differ from traditional "straight-through" programs that you have 
encountered in the first few chapters of this book.  One big difference is
that GUI programs are <span class="newword">event-driven</span>. That is, user actions such as
clicking on a button or pressing a key on the keyboard generate events, and the
program must respond to these events as they occur.</p>


<p>Event-driven programming builds on all the skills you have learned in the
first five chapters of this text. You need to be able to write the methods
that respond to events. Inside those methods, you are doing the kind of
programming-in-the-small that was covered in <a href="../c2/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>
and <a href="../c3/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>.
And of course, objects are everywhere in GUI programming.  
Events are objects. Colors and fonts are objects.  GUI components such as buttons and
menus are objects.  Events are handled by instance methods contained in objects. 
In Java, GUI programming is object-oriented programming.  The purpose of this chapter is, as
much as anything, to give you some experience with a large-scale object-oriented API.</p>


<p>Java has had several "toolkits" for building GUI program.  This textbook
uses <span class="newword">JavaFX</span> as its toolkit.  The previous version used
the Swing GUI toolkit, and if you are interested in learning Swing rather
than JavaFX, you should consult Chapter&nbsp;6 and Chapter&nbsp;13 in
that version, which is still available at
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes7">http://math.hws.edu/javanotes7</a>.</p>


<p>This chapter is just an introduction to JavaFX&nbsp;8, but it covers the
essential features of GUI programming in enough detail to write some
interesting programs.  The discussion of JavaFX will continue in <a href="../c13/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;13</a> 
with more details and with more advanced techniques, but complete coverage
of JavaFX would require an entire book of its own.</p>
