<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.4:</h3>
<p>In <a href="../c6/ex3-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;6.3</a>,
you wrote a graphical pair-of-dice program where the dice are rolled when the user clicks on
the canvas. Now make a pair-of-dice program where the user rolls the
dice by clicking a button.  The button should appear under the
canvas that shows the dice.  Also make the following change:  When the
dice are rolled, instead of just showing the new value, show a short animation
during which the values on the dice are changed in every frame.  The animation
is supposed to make the dice look more like they are actually rolling.</p>

<p>In <a href="../c6/ex3-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;6.3</a>, the entire window
was filled by a <span class="classname">Canvas</span>. In the new version, we need
both a canvas and a button.  We need to add both components to the container
that acts as the root of the scene graph.  I decided to use a <span class="code">BorderPane</span>
with the canvas in the center position and the button in the bottom position.
(Another option would have been a <span class="classname">VBox</span>.)
When I first tried this, the button only filled the left half of the
bottom position.  A <span class="code">BorderPane</span> wants to expand the components that
it contains to completely fill their positions in the layout,
but as mentioned in <a href="../c6/s5.html">Section&nbsp;6.5</a>, the problem is that
a <span class="classname">Button</span> has a maximum size that is just large enough
to hold the contents of the button.  The problem can be fixed by giving
the button a bigger maximum width.  After I did that, the button filled the
entire width of the window.  Here is the new <span class="code">start()</span> method:</p>


<pre>public void start(Stage stage) {
   
    canvas = new Canvas(100,100);
    draw();  // Draw the original dice.
    
    rollButton = new Button("Roll!");
    rollButton.setMaxWidth(1000);  // so button can grow to full width of window
    rollButton.setOnAction( e -&gt; roll() ); // When clicked, roll the dice.
    
    BorderPane root = new BorderPane();
    root.setCenter(canvas);
    root.setBottom(rollButton);
    
    Scene scene = new Scene(root);
    stage.setScene(scene);
    stage.setTitle("Dice!");
    stage.setResizable(false);
    stage.show();
          
} // end start()</pre>



<p>The method for drawing the dice was discussed in the solution to
<a href="../c6/ex3-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;6.3</a>.  But we still have to think about animating
the rolling of the dice.  The <span class="code">roll()</span> method is responsible
for rolling the dice.  In the original version, this method simply set
the numbers showing on the dice to random values and called <span class="code">draw()</span>.
In the new version, we want to repeat this action several times over a period
of time.  That is, we want an animation in which the action for each frame
is to randomize the numbers on the dice and call <span class="code">draw()</span>.</p>


<p>Animation is discussed in <a href="../c6/s3.html#GUI1.3.5">Subsection&nbsp;6.3.5</a>.  We need to
make a subclass of <span class="classname">AnimationTimer</span> and provide
a definition for the <span class="code">handle()</span> method.  That method will
be called once in each frame.  The timer can be defined using
an anonymous nested class (see <a href="../c5/s8.html#OOP.8.3">Subsection&nbsp;5.8.3</a>.)  In my program,
the timer is a global variable.  It might
seem like it would be enough to say:</p>


<pre>private AnimationTimer timer = new AnimationTimer() {
    public void handle( long time ) {
        die1 = (int)(Math.random()*6) + 1;
        die2 = (int)(Math.random()*6) + 1;
        draw();
    }
};</pre>


<p>Then, when the <span class="code">roll()</span> method is called, it could simply
call <span class="code">time.start()</span>.  But there is a big problem with this:
The animation should only go on for a short time.  In order to stop
it, <span class="code">timer.stop()</span> has to be called.  But who will call it,
and how will they know when to call it?  In fact, the timer can stop
itself after a certain number of frames have passed.  In order to do
that, I use a global <span class="code">frameNumber</span> variable.  When <span class="code">roll()</span>
starts the timer, it sets the frame number to 0:</p>


<pre>private void roll() {
   frameNumber = 0;
   rollButton.setDisable(true);
   timer.start(); // start an animation
}</pre>


<p>Note that it also
disables the button, so that the user will not be able to roll the dice
while they are already being rolled.  Then the timer's <span class="code">handle()</span>
method should increment the frame number, and it should stop itself if the frame number
has reached some maximum value.
It must also re-enable the button to make it possible to
roll the dice again.  So, here is the actual definition of the timer:</p>


<pre>private AnimationTimer timer = new AnimationTimer() {
        // The timer is used to animate "rolling" of the dice.
        // In each frame, the dice values are randomized.  When
        // the number of frames reaches 60, the timer stops itself.
        // The rollButton is disabled while an animation is in
        // progress, so it has to be enabled when the animation stops.
    public void handle( long time ) {
        die1 = (int)(Math.random()*6) + 1;
        die2 = (int)(Math.random()*6) + 1;
        draw();
        frameNumber++;
        if (frameNumber == 60) {
            timer.stop();
            rollButton.setDisable(false);
        }
    }
};</pre>


<p>The dice will change for 60 frames or about one second.  It might be that changing the dice
every 1/60 second is too fast.  Unfortunately, there is no way to slow down the
frame rate in an <span class="classname">AnimationTimer</span>.  However, it is certainly
possible to do nothing in some of the frames.  For example, if you only want
to change the dice every 10 frames, you can begin the <span class="code">handle()</span>
method by saying</p>


<pre>if (frameNumber % 10 != 0) {
       // do nothing if frameNumber is not a multiple of 10
    return;
}</pre>
