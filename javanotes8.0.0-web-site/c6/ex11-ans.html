<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 6.11</h2>
<hr class="break">
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.11:</h3>
<p>In the Blackjack game 
from <a href="../c6/ex10-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;6.10</a>, the user can click on the "Hit",
"Stand", and "NewGame" buttons even when it doesn't make sense to do so. It
would be better if the buttons were disabled at the appropriate times. The "New
Game" button should be disabled when there is a game in progress. The "Hit" and
"Stand" buttons should be disabled when there is <b>not</b> a game in progress. The
instance variable <span class="code">gameInProgress</span> tells whether or not a game is in
progress, so you just have to make sure that the buttons are properly enabled
and disabled whenever this variable changes value. 
I strongly advise writing a method that can be called every time it is
necessary to set the value of the <span class="code">gameInProgress</span> variable. That
method can take full responsibility for enabling and disabling the buttons
(as long as it is used consistently).
Recall that if <span class="code">bttn</span> is a variable of type <span class="code">Button</span>, then
<span class="code">bttn.setDisable(true)</span> disables the button and
<span class="code">bttn.setDisable(false)</span> enables the button.</p>


<p>As a second (and more difficult) improvement, make it possible
for the user to place bets on the Blackjack game. When the program starts, give
the user $100. Add a <span class="classname">TextField</span> to the strip of controls along the
bottom of the panel. The user enters the bet in this <span class="classname">TextField</span>.
When the game begins, check the amount of the bet. You should do this when the
game begins, not when it ends, because several errors can occur: The contents
of the <span class="classname">TextField</span> might not be a legal number, the bet that the user
places might be more money than the user has, or the bet might be &lt;= 0. You
should detect these errors and show an error message instead of starting the
game. The user's bet should be an integral number of dollars.</p>


<p>It would be a good idea to make the <span class="classname">TextField</span> uneditable while the
game is in progress. If <span class="code">betInput</span> is the <span class="classname">TextField</span>, you can
make it editable and uneditable by the user with the commands
<span class="code">betInput.setEditable(true)</span> and <span class="code">betInput.setEditable(false)</span>.</p>


<p>In the <span class="code">drawBoard()</span> method, you should include commands to
display the amount of money that the user has left.</p>


<p>There is one other thing to think about: Ideally, the program should not start a new
game when it is first created. The user should have a chance to set a bet
amount before the game starts. So, in the <span class="code">start()</span> method, you
should not call <span class="code">doNewGame()</span>. You might want to display a message such
as "Welcome to Blackjack" before the first game starts.</p>
   

<p>Here is a picture of my program:</p>

<p align="center">

<div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr>

<p>First, I want to briefly discuss the changes that I made to the appearance of
the user interface, compared to the program, <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter6/HighLowGUI.java">HighLowGUI.java</a></span>, on
which the Blackjack programs are based.</p>

<p>For Blackjack, I added a dark red border around the <span class="classname">BorderPane</span>
that serves as the <span class="code">root</span> node of the scene graph.  I also wanted
a red line between the canvas and the <span class="code">buttonBar</span> that is in the
bottom position.  For that, I added a border to <span class="code">buttonBar</span>, but only
on its top edge; the border width on the other three sides of the <span class="code">buttonBar</span>
is set to zero.</p>

<p>In <span class="classname">HighLowGUI</span>, the three buttons are all the same size,
and they fill the <span class="code">buttonBar</span>.  In the final version of Blackjack,
the button bar contains five components, and it didn't look good to make them
all the same width.  Furthermore, I wanted to give a nicer background color (beige)
to the button bar, and it needed some padding to add some space between the
components and the edges of the button bar.  Finally, to put the components that
it contains in the center of the button bar rather than at the left end,
the alignment property of the button bar is set to <span class="code">Pos.CENTER</span>.
So, in my Blackjack program,
the root node and button bar are created and configured in the <span class="code">start()</span>
method as follows:</p>


<pre>HBox buttonBar = new HBox(6, hitButton, standButton, newGameButton,
        new Label(" Your bet:"), betInput);
buttonBar.setStyle("-fx-border-color: darkred; -fx-border-width: 3px 0 0 0;" 
        + "-fx-padding: 8px; -fx-background-color:beige");
buttonBar.setAlignment(Pos.CENTER);

BorderPane root = new BorderPane();
root.setStyle("-fx-border-color: darkred; -fx-border-width: 3px");
root.setCenter(board);
root.setBottom(buttonBar);</pre>


<p>All of these details might seem very complicated, but it does get easier
with practice!</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>The buttons in the program must be enabled and
disabled whenever the value of the variable <span class="code">gameInProgress</span> changes. 
At the same time, the text field should be made editable or non-editable.  As
recommended in the exercise, I wrote a method for changing the value of 
<span class="code">gameInProgress</span>. This method also sets the buttons and text field to reflect the
state of the program, which allows the state of the buttons and text field
to be controlled in one location:</p>


<pre>/**
 * This method is called whenever the value of the gameInProgress
 * property has to be changed.  In addition to setting the value
 * of the gameInProgress variable, it also enables and disables
 * the buttons and text input box to reflect the state of the game.
 * @param inProgress The new value of gameInProgress.
 */
private void setGameInProgress( boolean inProgress ) {
    gameInProgress = inProgress;
    if (gameInProgress) {
        hitButton.setDisable(false);
        standButton.setDisable(false);
        newGameButton.setDisable(true);
        betInput.setEditable(false);
        hitButton.requestFocus();
    }
    else {
        hitButton.setDisable(true);
        standButton.setDisable(true);
        newGameButton.setDisable(false);
        betInput.setEditable(true);
        newGameButton.requestFocus();
    }
}</pre>


<p>Note that this method requests that the "Hit" button get focus of there is a game in progress,
and that the "New Game" button get focus if not.  When a button has the input focus, the user
can trigger the button by pressing Return.  The idea is to give the input focus to
the button that represents the user's most likely next action.  This makes it possible
for the user to play the game largely by hitting the space bar, instead of using the
mouse.  (In fact, since the TAB key can be used to move the input focus, the user can
play the game without ever touching the mouse.)</p>


<p>Once <span class="code">setGameInProgress()</span> is available, then any line in the old program that said
"<span class="code">gameInProgress&nbsp;=&nbsp;false;</span>" should be changed to
"<span class="code">setGameInProgress(false);</span>". And any line that said
"<span class="code">gameInProgress&nbsp;=&nbsp;true;</span>" should be changed to
"<span class="code">setGameInProgress(true);</span>". In this way, we can be sure that the
buttons are always properly enabled and disabled.  Note that I added a 
call to <span class="code">setGameInProgress(false)</span> to the <span class="code">start()</span> method
as well, to make sure the buttons and textfield are properly configured at the
beginning of the program.  Since the new program does not immediately start
the first game, <span class="code">gameInProgress</span> should be set to <span class="code">false</span>
in the <span class="code">start()</span> method. (Also, the call to <span class="code">doNewGame()</span>
in the <span class="code">start()</span> method was deleted).</p>


<p>You should understand why I use a subroutine to set the value of
<span class="code">gameInProgress</span>. Every time <span class="code">gameInProgress</span> changes, each of
the buttons has to be enabled or disabled and the text field has
to be made editable or uneditable. That's four extra lines of code
each time the program says <span class="code">gameInProgress&nbsp;=&nbsp;true</span> 
or <span class="code">gameInProgress&nbsp;=&nbsp;false</span>. We can avoid some extra typing by calling the subroutine.
Furthermore, if we always call the subroutine to set the value of
<span class="code">gameInProgress</span>, we can be sure that the states of the buttons and text field will
always be set correctly to match the value of <span class="code">gameInProgress</span>.
</p>
   

<p>The changes that I've discussed so far are enough to complete the first part
of the exercise, enabling and disabling the buttons.  We still have to implement
betting.</p>
   

<hr class="break">


<p>I added several new instance variables to the program to implement betting:
a <span class="classname">TextField</span>, <span class="code">betInput</span>, where the user
inputs the bet amount; an <span class="ptype">int</span> variable, <span class="code">usersMoney</span>,
to hold the number of dollars that the user currently has; and another
<span class="ptype">int</span> variable, <span class="code">betAmount</span>, to store the amount
of the user's bet while a game is in progress.</p>
   

<p>The <span class="classname">TextField</span> for the user's input
is created with the command "<span class="code">betInput = new
TextField("10");</span>". The parameter in the constructor specifies the
initial content of the text input box. This is meant as a reasonable value for
the bet, but the user can change it if she wants to.  The number of preferred
columns for the textfield is reduced by calling
<span class="code">betInput.setPrefColumnCount(5)</span>. The preferred size of the <span class="classname">TextField</span> is computed
based on the preferred column count.  Without this change, the textfield would be
too big for this program.</p>


<p>The value of <span class="code">usersMoney</span> is
initialized to 100 when it is declared. Any time a game ends, if the user wins,
then <span class="code">betAmount</span> is added to the user's money, and if the user loses, then
<span class="code">betAmount</span> is subtracted from the user's money. We have to decide what
happens if the user runs out of money. One possibility would be to shut the
game down, but that seems drastic since it's only play money anyway. So, if the
value of <span class="code">usersMoney</span> drops to zero, I give the user another $100 by
setting the value of <span class="code">usersMoney</span> back to 100; this is done in
<span class="code">doNewGame()</span> at the start of the next game.</p>
   

<p>At the beginning of a game in <span class="code">doNewGame()</span>, the program has to look at the number in the text
field to determine how much money the user wants to bet on the game.  Several things
can go wrong at this time: The text in the box might not be a legal integer,
the amount might be more money than the user has, and the value might be less than or
equal to zero.  Each of these possibilities has to be tested, and, if an error is detected,
an error message has to be shown to the user and no new game is started.
It's a little complicated:</p>
   

<pre>try {  // get the amount of the user's bet and check for errors
    betAmount = Integer.parseInt(betInput.getText());
}
catch (NumberFormatException e) {
    message = "Bet amount must be an integer!";
    betInput.requestFocus();
    betInput.selectAll();
    drawBoard();
    return;
}
if (betAmount &gt; usersMoney) {
    message = "The bet amount can't be more than you have!";
    betInput.requestFocus();
    betInput.selectAll();
    drawBoard();
    return;
}
if (betAmount &lt;= 0) {
    message = "The bet has to be a positive number";
    betInput.requestFocus();
    betInput.selectAll();
    drawBoard();
    return;
}</pre>


<p>If the program gets past all of these tests, it starts the game as it did in the old program.</p>
  

<p>When the game ends for any reason, the user's money has to be adjusted. There are many points
in the source code where the game ends. In each of those places, I inserted a line
"<span class="code">usersMoney = usersMoney + betAmount</span>" if the user won or
"<span class="code">usersMoney = usersMoney - betAmount</span>" if the user lost.  It might
have been a good idea to write another subroutine to handle this task.</p>
   

<p>I also added some code to the <span class="code">drawBoard()</span> method to display
the user's current amount of money. To accommodate this, this version of the panel is
25 pixels taller than the previous version.</p>


<p>If the first game has not started, <span class="code">drawBoard()</span> draws a welcome
message instead of showing the user's and dealer's hands.  There is the question
of how to test whether the first game has started.  The obvious (and perhaps best)
way to handle that would have been to add another <span class="ptype">boolean</span>
state variable such as <span class="code">firstGameHasStarted</span>.  However, I used
the fact that <span class="code">dealerHand</span> is <span class="code">null</span> before the first
game starts (and only then). So <span class="code">drawBoard()</span> can test whether
<span class="code">dealerHand</span> is <span class="code">null</span> to decide whether to draw the
welcome message.</p>
