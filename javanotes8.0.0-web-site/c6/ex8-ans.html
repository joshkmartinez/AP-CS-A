           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.8:</h3>
<p> Write a program that has a
<span class="classname">TextArea</span> where the user can enter some text. 
The program should have a
button such that when the user clicks on the button, the program will count the number
of lines in the user's input, the number of words in the user's input, and the
number of characters in the user's input. This information should be displayed
on three <span class="classname">Labels</span>. Recall that if <span class="code">textInput</span> is a
<span class="classname">TextArea</span>, then you can get the contents of the <span class="classname">TextArea</span> by
calling the function <span class="code">textInput.getText()</span>. This function returns a
<span class="classname">String</span> containing all the text from the text area. The number
of characters is just the length of this <span class="classname">String</span>. Lines in the
<span class="classname">String</span> are separated by the new line character, <span class="code">'\n'</span>, so the number of
lines is just the number of new line characters in the <span class="classname">String</span>, plus
one. Words are a little harder to count. <a href="../c3/ex4-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;3.4</a> 
has some advice about finding the
words in a <span class="classname">String</span>. Essentially, you want to count the number of
characters that are first characters in words.  Here is a picture of my solution:</p>

<p>The window contains five components. There are several ways to lay them out.
Since the <span class="classname">TextArea</span> is much larger than the other components,
my program uses a <span class="classname">VBox</span> as the <span class="code">root</span> of the scene graph, 
which allows each component to have its preferred height.</p>


<p>To get a dark blue border around the edges, I use CSS to add a border to the <span class="classname">VBox</span>.
To get blue lines between the components, I set the spacing between components in the <span class="classname">VBox</span>
to be 4, and I make its background dark blue.  I set the background color for the labels to be white;
otherwise, the usual transparent background for the labels would let the blue background of
the <span class="classname">VBox</span> show through.  I increased the maximum width of the labels to make
them fill the entire width of the <span class="classname">VBox</span>.  (Otherwise, the blue background would
show through in the space left empty by the labels.)  As for the button, I did not
want to increase its maximum width to fill the available space, but without that, the <span class="classname">VBox</span>
placed it on the left edge of the available space.  I wanted it to be centered.  The only way I could
think of to do that was to put the button inside another pane, and add that pane to the
<span class="classname">VBox</span>.  That pane will fill the available space.  I used a <span class="classname">BorderPane</span>
with the button as its center component; the parameter to the
<span class="classname">BorderPane</span>constructor becomes the center component in the layout,
and a <span class="classname">BorderPane</span> centers its center component
within the available space.  You can see how it's is all done in this code from the <span class="code">start()</span>
method:</p>


<pre>textInput = new TextArea();
    textInput.setPrefRowCount(15);
    textInput.setPrefColumnCount(30);

    /* Create the button and a listener to listen for
         clicks on the button. */

    Button countButton = new Button("Process the Text");
    countButton.setOnAction( e -&gt; processInput() );

    /* Create each of the labels, and set their properties. */
    
    String style = 
         "-fx-padding: 5px; -fx-font: bold 14pt serif; -fx-background-color: white";

    lineCountLabel = new Label("  Number of lines:");
    lineCountLabel.setStyle(style);
    lineCountLabel.setMaxWidth(1000);

    wordCountLabel = new Label("  Number of words:");
    wordCountLabel.setStyle(style);
    wordCountLabel.setMaxWidth(1000);

    charCountLabel = new Label("  Number of chars:");
    charCountLabel.setStyle(style);
    charCountLabel.setMaxWidth(1000);

    /* Use a VBox as the root component. */

    VBox root = new VBox( 4, textInput, new BorderPane(countButton),
                              lineCountLabel, wordCountLabel, charCountLabel );
    root.setStyle(
        "-fx-background-color: #009; -fx-border-color: #009; -fx-border-width:3px" );</pre>


<p>The first parameter to the <span class="classname">VBox</span> constructor is the spacing
between components, and the remaining parameter are added as child nodes of the
<span class="classname">VBox</span>. Note that both
<span class="code">countButton</span> IS wrapped in a pane which is then added to the
<span class="classname">VBox</span>.</p>


<p>The <span class="code">ActionEvent</span> handler for the button calls the 
method <span class="code">processInput()</span>.  That method does all the work of the program:
It gets the text from the <span class="code">TextArea</span>, does the
counting, and sets the labels. The only interesting part is counting the words.
Back in <a href="../c3/ex4-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;3.4</a>, words such as
"can't", that contain an apostrophe, were counted as two words. This time
around, let's handle this special case. Two letters with an apostrophe between
them should be counted as part of the same word. The algorithm for counting
words is still</p>


<pre>wordCt = 0
for each character in the string:
   if the character is the first character of a word:
      Add 1 to wordCt</pre>


<p>but testing whether a given character is the first character in a word has
gotten more complicated. To make the test easier, I use a boolean
variable, <span class="code">startOfWord</span>. The value of this variable is set to true if
the character is the start of a word and to false if not. That is, the
algorithm becomes:</p>


<pre>wordCt = 0
for each character in the string:
   Let startOfWord be true if at start of word, false otherwise
   if startOfWord is true:
      Add 1 to wordCt</pre>


<p>The use of a "flag variable" like <span class="code">startOfWord</span> can simplify the
calculation of a complicated boolean condition. The value is computed as a
series of tests:</p>


<pre>boolean startOfWord;  // Is character i the start of a word?
if ( Character.isLetter(text.charAt(i)) == false )
   startOfWord = false;  // No.  It's not a letter.
else if (i == 0)
   startOfWord = true;   // Yes.  It's a letter at start of text.
else if ( Character.isLetter(text.charAt(i-1)) )
   startOfWord = false;  // No.  It's a letter preceded by a letter.
else if ( text.charAt(i-1) == '\'' &amp;&amp; i &gt; 1 
                     &amp;&amp; Character.isLetter(text.charAt(i-2)) )
   startOfWord = false;  // No.  It's a continuation of a word
                         //      after an apostrophe.
else
   startOfWord = true;   // Yes.  It's a letter preceded by
                         //       a non-letter.</pre>


<p>The first test checks whether the character in position <span class="code">i</span> is a
letter. If it is not, then we know that it can't be the start of a word, so
<span class="code">startOfWord</span> is false. If it is a letter, it might be the start of a
word, so we go on to make additional tests. Note that if we get to the other
tests at all, we already know that the character in position <span class="code">i</span> is a
letter. And so on. This style of "cascading tests" is very useful. In each
test, we already have all the information from the previous tests. Note that
the cascade effect works only with "<span class="code">else if</span>". Using "<span class="code">if</span>" in
place of "<span class="code">else if</span>" in the preceding code would not give the right
answer. (You should be sure to understand why this is so.)  You should
also note why the test "<span class="code">if&nbsp;(i&nbsp;==&nbsp;0)</span>"" has to 
be made before the test <span class="code">if&nbsp;(&nbsp;Character.isLetter(text.charAt(i-1))&nbsp;)</span>"&mdash;that's
because <span class="code">text.charAt(i-1)</span> gives an index-out-of-bounds exception if <span class="code">i</span> is zero.</p>
