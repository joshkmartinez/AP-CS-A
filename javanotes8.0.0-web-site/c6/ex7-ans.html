<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 6.7</h2>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.7:</h3>
<p>
<a href="../c5/ex2-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;5.2</a> involved a class, <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter5/StatCalc.java">StatCalc.java</a></span>,
that could compute some statistics
of a set of numbers. Write a GUI program that uses the <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> class to
compute and display statistics of numbers entered by the user. The program will
have an instance variable of type <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> that does the computations.
The program should include a <span class="classname">TextField</span> where the user enters a number.
It should have four labels that display four statistics for the numbers that
have been entered: the number of numbers, the sum, the mean, and the standard
deviation. Every time the user enters a new number, the statistics displayed on
the labels should change. The user enters a number by typing it into the
<span class="classname">TextField</span> and then either clicking an "Enter" button or
pressing the Return (or Enter) key.  There should be a "Clear" button that
clears out all the data. This means creating a new <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> object and
changing the text that is displayed on the labels. 
(See the discussion of "default buttons" at the end of
<a href="../c6/s4.html#GUI1.4.2">Subsection&nbsp;6.4.2</a> for one way of implementing a response the Return key.)
Here is a picture of my solution to this problem:</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="stat-calc-gui.png" width="396" height="204" alt="screenshot from StatCalcGUI program"></p>

<p>Getting the interface to look just like I wanted it was the hardest part.
In the end, I used <span class="classname">TilePanes</span> (<a href="../c6/s5.html#GUI1.5.4">Subsection&nbsp;6.5.4</a>) for the layout.</p>

<hr>
<div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr>

<p>In my solution, I used four labels to display results from the <span class="classname">StatCalc</span>,
and another label at the top of the window to display a message to the user. Aside from these labels,
one row in the layout holds the other three components: a <span class="classname">TextField</span> and
two <span class="classname">Buttons</span>.  I want to spend some time talking about how I designed
the GUI for the program.  My first idea for layout was to use an <span class="classname">HBox</span> 
to hold the text field and buttons, and a <span class="classname">VBox</span> to line up the
<span class="classname">HBox</span> and the five labels vertically.  As I often do, I first
wrote the program without paying too much attention to appearance.  The result was
not very attractive:</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="StatCalcGUI-ugly.png" width="278" height="108" alt="first, unattractive version of StatCalcGUI"></p>
         

<p>Note in particular that there is not enough room in the bottom display labels to display
the numbers.  When this happens, a <span class="classname">Label</span> will automatically
modify the displayed string to use an ellipsis (...) to indicate that not all of
the text is shown.  (Buttons will do the same thing.)  When the labels were constructed,
the text in the constructor did not include the numbers, so the preferred size of
the labels was not large enough to allow enough space when the numbers were added
later.  This is often an issue when using labels and buttons whose text will change
while the program is running.</p>


<p>I could have worked to improve the appearance, but I decided that it would be easier
to do if I used <span class="classname">TilePanes</span> for layout.  My final program
uses a <span class="classname">TilePane</span> to hold the textfield and
buttons; the preferred number of columns for that <span class="classname">TilePane</span> is set to&nbsp;3.
And the program uses a <span class="classname">TilePane</span> with one column for the
overall layout.</p>


<p>Labels and buttons in a <span class="classname">TilePane</span> will not
automatically expand to fill their tiles, because of their default maximum size.
To allow them to expand, we have to increase their maximum sizes.  This can be
done by calling, for example, <span class="code">label.setMaxSize(1000,1000)</span>.
</p>


<p>I also reduced the number of preferred columns in the <span class="classname">TextField</span>,
since the default forced the preferred size of the scene to be larger than I liked.
With all of these changes, the interface looked much nicer:</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="StatCalcGUI-less-ugly.png" width="365" height="173" alt="second, more attractive version of StatCalcGUI"></p>


<p>This would have been satisfactory, but I wanted something a little more dramatic.
I decided to add lines between the labels.  I could have done that by adding black borders
to the labels, but I decided to use a different approach.  I set the horizontal and
vertical gaps on the <span class="classname">TilePanes</span> to be 3 pixels.  The background
will show through the gaps, so I got my black lines by setting the background color of the
root <span class="classname">TilePane</span> to be black, instead of the usual light gray.
Unfortunately, the default background for a label is transparent, which meant that all the labels
were filled with the black background of the root <span class="classname">TilePane</span>,
hiding the text, which was also black!  To fix that,
I set the text color for the top label to be white, and I set the background color
for the other four labels to be white.  This finally gave me the look that I wanted.
I should emphasize that the approach that I used is not by any means the only one
that would have worked.</p>


<hr class="break">         


<p>Turning to the actual programming, consider the labels that display
the results from the <span class="classname">StatCalc</span>.
Since there are four labels to create, I wrote a method to
create and configure them:</p>


<pre>/**
 * A utility routine for creating the labels that are used
 * for display.  This routine is used in the start() method.
 */
private Label makeLabel(String text) {
   Label label = new Label(text);
   label.setMaxSize(1000,1000);
   label.setStyle("-fx-background-color:white; " +
                        "-fx-font-family: monospace; -fx-font-weight: bold");
   return label;
} </pre>


<p>Note that the maximum width and height of the label have been made quite
large.  CSS styling (<a href="../c6/s2.html#GUI1.2.5">Subsection&nbsp;6.2.5</a>) is used to set the background color to be white
and to use a bold monospace font.  (A monospace font is used since every
character in a monospace font has the same width, making it easy to
line up the numbers vertically in the labels.  JavaFX 8 seems to have no
way to ensure that a font will be monospace, except to use CSS.)</p>


<p>Then in the <span class="code">start()</span> method, the labels can be created with four
statements, instead of 12:</p>


<pre>countLabel =   makeLabel(" Number of Entries:  0");
sumLabel =     makeLabel(" Sum:                0.0");
meanLabel =    makeLabel(" Average:            undefined");
standevLabel = makeLabel(" Standard Deviation: undefined");</pre>


<p>Utility routines like <span class="code">makeLabel()</span> are very commonly used when there
are a lot of similar components to create. Note that when the labels are first
created, the text on the labels is appropriate for a dataset that contains zero
elements. In particular, if there is no data, the average and standard
deviation are undefined.</p>


<p>An <span class="code">ActionEvent</span> handler is installed on each button.  The handler
calls an appropriate method that is defined elsewhere in the class.
The "Enter" button is made into the default button for the program
by calling <span class="code">enterButton.setDefaultButton(true)</span>, as suggested
in the instructions for the exercise.  Note in the
screenshot from the program that this also changes the appearance of the
"Enter" button.  Here is the code that creates and configures the buttons:</p>


<pre>enterButton = new Button("Enter");
enterButton.setOnAction( e -&gt; doEnter() );
enterButton.setMaxSize(1000,1000);
enterButton.setDefaultButton(true);

clearButton = new Button("Clear");
clearButton.setOnAction( e -&gt; doClear() );
clearButton.setMaxSize(1000,1000);</pre>


<p>In the <span class="code">doClear()</span> method, the response to the "Clear" button is to create a new
<span class="classname">StatCalc</span> object and to reset the display labels to reflect the fact
that there is no data in the dataset.  The labels are changed by another method, 
<span class="code">showData()</span>:</p>


<pre>private void doClear() {
    stats = new StatCalc();
    numberInput.setText("");
    showData();
}</pre>


<p>Here, <span class="code">stats</span> is a global variable of type <span class="code">StatCalc</span> that is
used to do the calculations in the program.  It's important to understand the effect
of the command "<span class="code">stats&nbsp;=&nbsp;new&nbsp;StatCalc();</span>". The program will continue to
use the same <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> <b>variable</b>, <span class="code">stats</span>. However, now
the variable refers to a new <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> <b>object</b>. The new object
does not yet have any data in its dataset. When <span class="code">showData()</span> is called,
it is working with a <span class="code">StatCalc</span> object to which no data has been added.
The next time the user enters a
number, the dataset will get its first value. Always keep in mind the
difference between variables and objects. Also, keep in mind that you have to
think in terms of changing the state of the program in response to events. I
change the program's state by starting to use a new <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> object,
and I call <span class="code">showData()</span> to change the display labels to keep them consistent with the new
state.</p>


<p>When the user clicks the "Enter" button or presses Return, another method, <span class="code">doEnter()</span> is called.
That method has to get the user's input, add it to the
<span class="classname">StatCalc</span> object, and then call <span class="code">showData()</span>
to change the display labels to show the new values. The code
for getting the user's number from the input box includes a check to make sure that the user's
input is a legal number. If the input is not legal, then the method shows an error
message in the <span class="classname">Label</span> at the top of the window, which is represented by
a global variable named <span class="code">message</span>:</p>


<pre>private void doEnter() {
    double num;  // The user's number.
    try {
        num = Double.parseDouble(numberInput.getText());
    }
    catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            // The user's entry is not a legal number.  
            // Put an error message in the message label 
            // and return without entering a number.
        message.setText("\"" + numberInput.getText() + "\" is not a legal number.");
        numberInput.selectAll();
        numberInput.requestFocus();
        return;
    }
    stats.enter(num);
    showData();
}</pre>


<p>When an error is detected, the method returns immediately, since there is
no data to process.
The commands "<span class="code">numberInput.selectAll();</span>" and
"<span class="code">numberInput.requestFocus();</span>" are there as a convenience for the user.
The first command
selects all the text in the textfield. The second
command gives the input focus to the textfield. That way, the user can just
start typing the next number, without having to click on the input box or erase
the content of the box. (Since the contents of the box are selected, they will
disappear automatically when the user starts typing, to be replaced with the
new input. A surprising number of people have never learned that text
selections work this way.)</p>


<p>Once we have the user's number, the command "<span class="code">stats.enter(num);</span>"
adds the number <span class="code">num</span> into the dataset. In the <span class="code">showData()</span>
method, the statistics about the data
set can be obtained by calling the functions <span class="code">stats.getCount()</span>,
<span class="code">stats.getSum()</span>, <span class="code">stats.getMean()</span>, and
<span class="code">stats.getStandardDeviation()</span>. (This information can be found by reading
the <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter5/StatCalc.java">source code</a></span> for the <span class="classname">StatCalc</span>
class.)  These values are used on the labels that display the statistics.  For example,</p>


<pre>countLabel.setText(" Number of Entries:  " + stats.getCount());</pre>


<p>Returning to the topic of variables versus objects, a common novice mistake would
be to try to change the text that is displayed on the label by saying</p>


<pre>countLabel = new Label(" Number of Entries:  " + stats.getCount());  <span class="newcode">// WRONG</span>
</pre>


<p>since that type of command is what was used to set the text in the first
place.  But this statement has no effect on what is displayed on the screen.
The reason why this doesn't work is instructive:  The assignment
command creates a new <span class="classname">Label</span> and sets <span class="code">countLabel</span> to refer to
that new object.  The new label does indeed have the desired text.  But the
new label has nothing to do with what's on the screen!  The original label was
created in the constructor and added to the root tilepane.  It is the <b>original</b>
label object that is in the scene graph, so the original label continues to appear on the screen
even if the instance variable <span class="code">countLabel</span> now refers to a different label object.  The correct command,
using <span class="code">countLabel.setText()</span>, <b>modifies the original label object</b>,
which is what is shown on the screen.</p>


<p>As a point of interest, I will mention another technique.  You might want to limit the number of decimal places that
are displayed in the statistics.  You know how to do this in output to the command
line, using <span class="code">System.out.printf</span>, but we are not 
outputting the data here, just putting it into a String.  The <span class="classname">String</span>
class has a <span class="code">static</span> method <span class="code">String.format()</span> that solves this
problem.  <span class="code">String.format(fmtString,val,val,val,...)</span> works similarly
to <span class="code">System.out.printf(fmtString,val,val,val,...)</span>, but instead of producing
output, <span class="code">String.format</span> just creates a string and returns it.
To set the text of the label that displays the average, for example, you Might say:</p>


<pre>meanLabel.setText( String.format(" Average:            %1.8g", stats.getMean()) );</pre>


<p>I don't do this in my solution, but <span class="code">String.format()</span> can be very useful</p>
