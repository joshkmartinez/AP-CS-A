<p>
<span class="start"><big>U</big>nderstanding how programs work</span> is one thing.
Designing a program to perform some particular task is another thing
altogether. In <a href="../c3/s2.html">Section&nbsp;3.2</a>, I discussed how pseudocode and
stepwise refinement can be used to methodically develop an algorithm. We can
now see how subroutines can fit into the process.</p>
      

<p>Stepwise refinement is inherently a top-down process, but the process does
have a "bottom," that is, a point at which you stop refining the pseudocode
algorithm and translate what you have directly into proper program code.
In the absence of subroutines, the process would not bottom out until
you get down to the level of assignment statements and very primitive
input/output operations. But if you have subroutines lying around to perform
certain useful tasks, you can stop refining as soon as you've managed to
express your algorithm in terms of those tasks.</p>


<p>This allows you to add a bottom-up element to the top-down approach of
stepwise refinement. Given a problem, you might start by writing some
subroutines that perform tasks relevant to the problem domain. The subroutines
become a toolbox of ready-made tools that you can integrate into your algorithm
as you develop it. (Alternatively, you might be able to buy or find a software
toolbox written by someone else, containing subroutines that you can use in
your project as black boxes.)</p>


<p>Subroutines can also be helpful even in a strict top-down approach. As you
refine your algorithm, you are free at any point to take any sub-task in the
algorithm and make it into a subroutine. Developing that subroutine then
becomes a separate problem, which you can work on separately. Your main
algorithm will merely call the subroutine. This, of course, is just a way of
breaking your problem down into separate, smaller problems. It is still a
top-down approach because the top-down analysis of the problem tells you what
subroutines to write. In the bottom-up approach, you start by writing or
obtaining subroutines that are relevant to the problem domain, and you build
your solution to the problem on top of that foundation of subroutines.</p>


<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="subroutines.6.1">4.7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Preconditions and Postconditions</a>
</h3>


<p>When working with subroutines as building blocks, it is important to be
clear about how a subroutine interacts with the rest of the program. This
interaction is specified by the <span class="newword">contract</span> of the
subroutine, as discussed in <a href="../c4/s1.html">Section&nbsp;4.1</a>. A convenient
way to express the contract of a subroutine is in terms of 
<span class="newword">preconditions</span> and <span class="newword">postconditions</span>.</p>


<p>A precondition of a subroutine is something that must be true when the
subroutine is called, if the subroutine is to work correctly. For example, for
the built-in function <span class="code">Math.sqrt(x)</span>, a precondition is that the
parameter, <span class="code">x</span>, is greater than or equal to zero, since it is not
possible to take the square root of a negative number. In terms of a contract,
a precondition represents an obligation of the <i>caller</i> of the subroutine.
If you call a subroutine without meeting its precondition, then there is no
reason to expect it to work properly. The program might crash or give incorrect
results, but you can only blame yourself, not the subroutine, because you
haven't lived up to your side of the deal.</p>


<p>A postcondition of a subroutine represents the other side of the contract.
It represents an obligation of the subroutine.
It is something that will be true after the subroutine has run (assuming that
its preconditions were met&mdash;and that there are no bugs in the subroutine).
The postcondition of the function <span class="code">Math.sqrt()</span> is that the square of
the value that is returned by this function is equal to the parameter that is
provided when the subroutine is called. Of course, this will only be true if
the precondition&mdash;that the parameter is greater than or equal to zero&mdash;is
met. A postcondition of the built-in subroutine <span class="code">System.out.print(x)</span> is
that the value of the parameter has been displayed on the screen.</p>


<p>Preconditions most often give restrictions on the acceptable values of
parameters, as in the example of <span class="code">Math.sqrt(x)</span>. However, they can also
refer to global variables that are used in the subroutine.  Or, if it only makes
sense to call the subroutine at certain times, the precondition might refer to 
the state that the program must be in when the subroutine is called.</p>


<p>The postcondition of a subroutine, on the other hand, 
specifies the task that it performs. For a function, the
postcondition should specify the value that the function returns.</p>


<p>Subroutines are sometimes described by comments that explicitly specify their
preconditions and postconditions. When you are given a pre-written subroutine,
a statement of its preconditions and postconditions tells you how to use it and
what it does. When you are assigned to write a subroutine, the preconditions
and postconditions give you an exact specification of what the subroutine is
expected to do. I will use this approach in the example that constitutes the
rest of this section. The comments are given in the form of
<a href="../c4/s6.html#subroutines.5.4">Javadoc comments</a>, but I will explicitly
label the preconditions and postconditions.  (Many computer scientists think that new doc
tags <span class="code">@precondition</span> and <span class="code">@postcondition</span> should
be added to the Javadoc system for explicit labeling of preconditions
and postconditions, but that has not yet been done.)</p>




<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="subroutines.6.2">4.7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;A Design Example</a>
</h3>


<p>Let's work through an example of program design using subroutines. In this
example, we will use pre-written subroutines as building blocks and we will also design
new subroutines that we need to complete the project.  The API that I will use here
is defined in two classes that I have written, <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter4/Mosaic.java">Mosaic.java</a></span>, which in turns depends on
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter4/MosaicCanvas.java">MosaicCanvas.java</a></span>.  To compile and run a program that uses the
API, the classes <span class="classname">Mosaic</span> and <span class="classname">MosaicCanvas</span>
must be available.  That is, the files <span class="code">Mosaic.java</span> and
<span class="code">MosaicCanvas.java</span>, or the corresponding compiled class files,
must be in the same folder as the class that defines the program.</p>


<p>So, suppose that I have access to an already-written class called <span class="code">Mosaic</span>.
This class allows a program to work with a window that displays little colored
rectangles arranged in rows and columns. The window can be opened, closed, and
otherwise manipulated with static member subroutines defined in the
<span class="code">Mosaic</span> class.  In fact, the class defines a toolbox or API
that can be used for working with such windows.  Here are some of the
available routines in the API, with Javadoc-style comments. (Remember that
a Javadoc comment comes before the thing that it is commenting on.)</p>
   

<pre>/**
 * Opens a "mosaic" window on the screen.  This subroutine should be called
 * before any of the other Mosaic subroutines are used.  The program will end
 * when the user closes the window.
 *
 * Precondition:   The parameters rows, cols, h, and w are positive integers.
 * Postcondition:  A window is open on the screen that can display rows and
 *                   columns of colored rectangles.  Each rectangle is w pixels
 *                   wide and h pixels high.  The number of rows is given by
 *                   the first parameter and the number of columns by the
 *                   second.  Initially, all rectangles are black.
 *
 * Note:  The rows are numbered from 0 to rows - 1, and the columns are 
 * numbered from 0 to cols - 1.
 */
<span class="newcode">public static void open(int rows, int cols, int h, int w)</span>
   
   
/**
 * Sets the color of one of the rectangles in the window.
 *
 * Precondition:   row and col are in the valid range of row and column numbers,
 *                   and r, g, and b are in the range 0 to 255, inclusive.
 * Postcondition:  The color of the rectangle in row number row and column
 *                   number col has been set to the color specified by r, g,
 *                   and b.  r gives the amount of red in the color with 0 
 *                   representing no red and 255 representing the maximum 
 *                   possible amount of red.  The larger the value of r, the 
 *                   more red in the color.  g and b work similarly for the 
 *                   green and blue color components.
 */
<span class="newcode">public static void setColor(int row, int col, int r, int g, int b)</span>

   
/**
 * Gets the red component of the color of one of the rectangles.
 *
 * Precondition:   row and col are in the valid range of row and column numbers.
 * Postcondition:  The red component of the color of the specified rectangle is
 *                   returned as an integer in the range 0 to 255 inclusive.
 */
<span class="newcode">public static int getRed(int row, int col)</span>

   
/**
 * Like getRed, but returns the green component of the color.
 */
<span class="newcode">public static int getGreen(int row, int col)</span>

   
/**
 * Like getRed, but returns the blue component of the color.
 */
<span class="newcode">public static int getBlue(int row, int col)</span>

   
/**
 * Inserts a delay in the program (to regulate the speed at which the colors
 * are changed, for example).
 *
 * Precondition:   milliseconds is a positive integer.
 * Postcondition:  The program has paused for at least the specified number
 *                   of milliseconds, where one second is equal to 1000
 *                   milliseconds.
 */
<span class="newcode">public static void delay(int milliseconds)</span>
</pre>
   

<p>Remember that these subroutines are members of the <span class="code">Mosaic</span>
class, so when they are called from outside <span class="code">Mosaic</span>, the name of the class
must be included as part of the name of the routine.  For example,
we'll have to use the name <span class="code">Mosaic.isOpen()</span> rather than simply
<span class="code">isOpen()</span>.</p>


<p>You'll notice that the comments on the subroutine don't specify what
happens when the preconditions are <b>not</b> met.  Although a subroutine
is not really obligated by its contract to do anything particular in that
case, it would be good to know what happens.  For example, if the
precondition, "row and col are in the valid range of row and column numbers,"
on the <span class="code">setColor()</span> or <span class="code">getRed()</span> routine is violated,
an <span class="classname">IllegalArgumentException</span> will be thrown.
Knowing that fact would allow you to write programs that catch and handle
the exception, and it would be good to document it with a <span class="code">@throws</span>
doc tag in the Javadoc comment.
Other questions remain about the behavior of the subroutines.
For example, what happens if you call <span class="code">Mosaic.open()</span> and there
is already a mosaic window open on the screen?  (In fact, the second call will
simply be ignored.)  It's difficult to fully document
the behavior of a piece of software&mdash;sometimes, you just have to 
experiment or look at the full source code.</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>My idea for a program is to use the <span class="code">Mosaic</span> class as the basis for a neat
animation. I want to fill the window with randomly colored squares, and then
randomly change the colors in a loop that continues as long as the window is
open. "Randomly change the colors" could mean a lot of different things, but
after thinking for a while, I decide it would be interesting to have a
"disturbance" that wanders randomly around the window, changing the color of
each square that it encounters. Here's a picture showing what the contents of the window
might look like at one point in time:</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="mosaic.png" width="404" height="324" alt="a 20-by-16 grid of randomly colored squares"></p>



<p>With basic routines for manipulating the window as a foundation, I can turn
to the specific problem at hand. A basic outline for my program is</p>


<pre>Open a Mosaic window
Fill window with random colors
Move around, changing squares at random</pre>


<p>Filling the window with random colors seems like a nice coherent task that I
can work on separately, so let's decide to write a separate subroutine to do
it. The third step can be expanded a bit more, into the steps: Start in the
middle of the window, then keep moving to new squares and changing the color
of those squares. This should continue as long as the mosaic window is still
open. Thus we can refine the algorithm to:</p>


<pre>Open a Mosaic window
Fill window with random colors
Set the current position to the middle square in the window
As long as the mosaic window is open:
   Randomly change color of the square at the current position
   Move current position up, down, left, or right, at random</pre>


<p>I need to represent the current position in some way. That can be done with
two <span class="ptype">int</span> variables named <span class="code">currentRow</span> and
<span class="code">currentColumn</span> that hold the row number and the column number of 
the square where the disturbance is currently located.  I'll use 16 rows and 20 columns of squares in my
mosaic, so setting the current position to be in the center means setting
<span class="code">currentRow</span> to 8 and <span class="code">currentColumn</span> to 10. I already have a
subroutine, <span class="code">Mosaic.open()</span>, to open the window. To keep the main
routine simple, I decide that I will write two more subroutines of my own to
carry out the two tasks in the while loop. The algorithm can then be written in
Java as:</p>


<pre>Mosaic.open(16,20,25,25)
fillWithRandomColors();
currentRow = 8;       // Middle row, halfway down the window.
currentColumn = 10;   // Middle column.
while ( true ) { // Program ends when user closes the window.
    changeToRandomColor(currentRow, currentColumn);
    randomMove();      
}</pre>


<p>With the proper wrapper, this is essentially the <span class="code">main()</span> routine of
my program. It turns out I decided to make one small modification after running the
completed program: To prevent the
animation from running too fast, I added the line "<span class="code">Mosaic.delay(10);</span>"
to the <span class="code">while</span> loop.</p>


<p>The <span class="code">main()</span> routine is taken care of, but to complete the program, I
still have to write the subroutines <span class="code">fillWithRandomColors()</span>,
<span class="code">changeToRandomColor(int,int)</span>, and <span class="code">randomMove()</span>. Writing each
of these subroutines is a separate, small task. The
<span class="code">fillWithRandomColors()</span> routine is defined by the postcondition that
"each of the rectangles in the mosaic has been changed to a random color."
Pseudocode for an algorithm to accomplish this task can be given as:</p>


<pre>For each row:
   For each column:
      set the square in that row and column to a random color</pre>


<p>"For each row" and "for each column" can be implemented as for loops. We've
already planned to write a subroutine <span class="code">changeToRandomColor</span> that can be
used to set the color. (The possibility of reusing subroutines in several
places is one of the big payoffs of using them!) So,
<span class="code">fillWithRandomColors()</span> can be written in proper Java as:</p>


<pre>static void fillWithRandomColors() {
   int row, column;
   for ( row = 0; row &lt; 16; row++ )
      for ( column = 0; column &lt; 20; column++ )
         changeToRandomColor(row,column);
}</pre>


<p>Turning to the <span class="code">changeToRandomColor</span> subroutine, we already have a
method in the <span class="code">Mosaic</span> class, <span class="code">Mosaic.setColor()</span>, 
that can be used to change the
color of a square. If we want a random color, we just have to choose random
values for <span class="code">r</span>, <span class="code">g</span>, and <span class="code">b</span>. According to the
precondition of the <span class="code">Mosaic.setColor()</span> subroutine, these random values
must be integers in the range from 0 to 255. A formula for randomly selecting
such an integer is "<span class="code">(int)(256*Math.random())</span>". So the random color
subroutine becomes:</p>


<pre>static void changeToRandomColor(int rowNum, int colNum) {
     int red = (int)(256*Math.random());
     int green = (int)(256*Math.random());  
     int blue = (int)(256*Math.random());
     Mosaic.setColor(rowNum,colNum,red,green,blue);  
}</pre>


<p>Finally, consider the <span class="code">randomMove</span> subroutine, which is supposed to
randomly move the disturbance up, down, left, or right. To make a random choice
among four directions, we can choose a random integer in the range 0 to 3. If
the integer is 0, move in one direction; if it is 1, move in another direction;
and so on. The position of the disturbance is given by the variables
<span class="code">currentRow</span> and <span class="code">currentColumn</span>. To "move up" means to subtract
1 from <span class="code">currentRow</span>. This leaves open the question of what to do if
<span class="code">currentRow</span> becomes -1, which would put the disturbance above the
window (which would violate a precondition of several of the <span class="classname">Mosaic</span>
subroutines).
Rather than let this happen, I decide to move the disturbance to the
opposite edge of the grid by setting <span class="code">currentRow</span> to 15. (Remember that
the 16 rows are numbered from 0 to 15.)  An alternative to jumping to the opposite
edge would be to simply do nothing in this case.  Moving the disturbance down, left, or
right is handled similarly. If we use a <span class="code">switch</span> statement to decide
which direction to move, the code for <span class="code">randomMove</span> becomes:</p>


<pre>int directionNum;
directionNum = (int)(4*Math.random());
switch (directionNum) {
   case 0:  // move up 
      currentRow--;
      if (currentRow &lt; 0)   // CurrentRow is outside the mosaic;
         currentRow = 15;   // move it to the opposite edge.
      break;
   case 1:  // move right
      currentColumn++;
      if (currentColumn &gt;= 20)
         currentColumn = 0;
      break; 
   case 2:  // move down
      currentRow++;
      if (currentRow &gt;= 16)
         currentRow = 0;
      break;
   case 3:  // move left
      currentColumn--;
      if (currentColumn &lt; 0)
         currentColumn = 19;
      break; 
}</pre>
