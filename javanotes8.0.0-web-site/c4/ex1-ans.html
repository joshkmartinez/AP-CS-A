<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 4.1</h2>

<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 4.1:</h3>
<p>To "capitalize" a string
means to change the first letter of each word in the string to upper case (if
it is not already upper case). For example, a capitalized version of "Now is
the time to act!" is "Now Is The Time To Act!". Write a subroutine named
<span class="code">printCapitalized</span> that will print a capitalized version of a string to
standard output. The string to be printed should be a parameter to the
subroutine. Test your subroutine with a <span class="code">main()</span> routine that gets a
line of input from the user and applies the subroutine to it.</p>

<p>Note that a letter is the first letter of a word if it is not immediately
preceded in the string by another letter. Recall from <a href="../c3/ex4-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;3.4</a> that there is a standard
<span class="ptype">boolean</span>-valued function <span class="code">Character.isLetter(char)</span> that can be
used to test whether its parameter is a letter. There is another standard
<span class="ptype">char</span>-valued function, <span class="code">Character.toUpperCase(char)</span>, that
returns a capitalized version of the single character passed to it as a
parameter. That is, if the parameter is a letter, it returns the upper-case
version. If the parameter is not a letter, it just returns a copy of the
parameter.</p>

<hr>
<p>We are told the name of the subroutine and that it has one parameter of type
<span class="classname">String</span>. The name of the parameter is not specified. I will use
<span class="code">str</span>. The return type is <span class="code">void</span> because the subroutine does not
return a value. (It displays a value to the user, but to <b>return</b> a value means
to return it to the line in the program where the function is called. The value
returned by a function is generally <b>not</b> displayed to the user
by the function.) The first line of the subroutine definition will be:</p>


<pre>static  void  printCapitalized( String str )</pre>


<p>The subroutine must look at each character in <span class="code">str</span> and decide
whether to capitalize it or not. An algorithm for the subroutine is</p>


<pre>for each character in str:
    if the character is the first letter of a word:
        Print a capitalized version of the character
    else:
        Print the character
Print a carriage return to end the line of output</pre>


<p>The test as to whether a character is the first letter of a word is
surprisingly complicated. A test that almost works is: "If the character is a
letter and the preceding character is not a letter." The problem is that if the
character is the first character is the string, then there is no preceding
character! If the character is <span class="code">str.charAt(i)</span>, then the preceding
character would be <span class="code">str.charAt(i-1)</span>, but <span class="code">str.charAt(i-1)</span>
doesn't exist if <span class="code">i</span> is <span class="code">0</span>. You should notice the
problem when you look at <span class="code">str.charAt(i-1)</span> and remember that
the <span class="code">charAt()</span> method has the precondition that its parameter
must be greater than or equal to zero.  When <span class="code">i</span> is zero in
<span class="code">str.charAt(i-1)</span>, that precondition is not satisfied.
</p>


<p>Let's look at Java code that suffers
from this bug. Recall that the operator "<span class="code">!</span>" stands for "not."</p>


<pre>for ( i = 0;  i &lt; str.length();  i++ ) {        // <span class="newcode">BUGGY CODE!</span>
    ch = str.charAt( i );
    if ( Character.isLetter(ch) &amp;&amp; ! Character.isLetter(str.charAt(i-1)) )
        System.out.print( Character.toUpperCase(ch) );
    else
        System.out.print( ch );
}
System.out.println();</pre>


<p>This will crash when <span class="code">i</span> is zero, if the first character in the string
is indeed a letter. There are several ways to work
around the problem, and all of them are techniques that are worth knowing. The
first is to use a more complicated test in the <span class="code">if</span> statement: "if the
character is a letter and either it's the first character in the string or the
previous character is not a letter". In Java, this is:</p>


<pre>if (Character.isLetter(ch) &amp;&amp; (i==0 || ! Character.isLetter(str.charAt(i-1))))</pre>
   

<p>This avoids testing <span class="code">str.charAt(i-1)</span> in the case when <span class="code">i</span> is zero.
But it can be difficult to get
such a complicated test right. Another possibility is a bit sneaky: Add an
extra character onto the beginning of <span class="code">str</span>, and then start the
<span class="code">for</span> loop with <span class="code">i=1</span>. Any character will do, as long as it's not
a letter. For example, you could say "<span class="code">str&nbsp;=&nbsp;"."&nbsp;+&nbsp;str;</span>" Since the
<span class="code">for</span> loop starts at <span class="code">i=1</span>, the "." is not copied to output, and
the problem of <span class="code">i&nbsp;==&nbsp;0</span> doesn't arise. The method that I will use is
similar, but it doesn't require any modification of <span class="code">str</span>. I'll use
another variable to represent the preceding character in the string, except
that at the beginning of the string, I'll set it to the arbitrary value, '.'.
At the end of the loop, the character that we have just processed becomes the
"previous character" in the next iteration of the loop. Here is the complete
subroutine, using this method:</p>


<pre>static void printCapitalized( String str ) {
   char ch;       // One of the characters in str.
   char prevCh;   // The character that comes before ch in the string.
   int i;         // A position in str, from 0 to str.length()-1.
   prevCh = '.';  // Prime the loop with any non-letter character.
   for ( i = 0;  i &lt; str.length();  i++ ) {
      ch = str.charAt(i);
      if ( Character.isLetter(ch)  &amp;&amp;  ! Character.isLetter(prevCh) )
          System.out.print( Character.toUpperCase(ch) );
      else
          System.out.print( ch );
      prevCh = ch;  // prevCh for next iteration is ch.
   }
   System.out.println();
}</pre>


<p>Keeping track of a previous value in a loop is a very common programming pattern.
This doesn't exhaust the possibilities. Another idea, for example, would be
to use a boolean variable to keep track of whether the previous character was a
letter.</p>


<p>Finally, we should add a <a href="../c4/s6.html#subroutines.5.4">Javadoc comment</a> to document the subroutine.
Writing a <span class="code">main()</span> routine to test this subroutine on a line of input
is easy.</p>
