<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 4.8</h2>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 4.8:</h3>
<p>Write a program that administers a basic addition quiz to the user.
There should be ten questions.  Each question is a simple addition problem such as
<span class="code">17&nbsp;+&nbsp;42</span>, where the numbers in the problem are chosen at random
(and are not too big).  The program should ask the user all ten questions and get
the user's answers.  After asking all the questions, the user should print each question
again, with the user's answer.  If the user got the answer right, the program should
say so; if not, the program should give the correct answer.  At the end, tell the user
their score on the quiz, where each correct answer counts for ten points.</p>

<p>The program should use three subroutines, one to create the quiz, one to administer
the quiz, and one to grade the quiz.  It can use three arrays, with three global variables of type
<span class="atype">int[]</span>, to refer to the arrays.  The first array holds the first number from every
question, the second holds the second number from every questions, and the third holds
the user's answers.</p>

<hr>

<p>The statement of the problem has already made a lot of decisions for us.  We are told
to use three global variables of type <span class="atype">int[]</span>.  The variables must be <span class="code">static</span>,
and I have chosen to make them <span class="code">private</span>, so the declarations become:
</p>

<pre>private static int[] firstNumbers;  // The first numbers in all ten questions.
private static int[] secondNumbers; // The second numbers in all ten questions.
private static int[] userAnswers;   // The user's answers to the ten questions.
</pre>

<p>Note that these declarations are not in any subroutine.  These statements only create variables, not
arrays. We still need to create three arrays of length 10.  The arrays can be created using 
the <span class="code">new</span> operator.  This initialization could in fact be combined with the
declaration of the variables:</p>

<pre>private static int[] firstNumbers = new int[10];
private static int[] secondNumbers = new int[10];
private static int[] userAnswers = new int[10];</pre>

<p>Another possibility would be to create the three arrays at the beginning of the
<span class="code">main()</span> routine.  In fact, I chose to create them in the subroutines where
they are first used.</p>

<p>The program has three stages&mdash;create the problems, administer the quiz, and grade the
quiz&mdash;and we are told to write a subroutine to do each stage.  The main program simply
has to call the subroutines:</p>

<pre>public static void main(String[] args) {
    createQuiz();
    administerQuiz();
    gradeQuiz();
}</pre>

<p>(However, I added a couple of output statements at the start.)  
This is an example of using subroutines to break up a large task into several simpler
subtasks, so that programming each subtask becomes a separate problem.  The subroutines
are short and not too hard to write.  Looking at <span class="code">administerQuiz()</span> as an example,
note that the user's answers have to be stored in the array, <span class="code">userAnswers</span>,
so that they can be used when grading the quiz.  I create the array itself before asking
any questions, and then store the user's responses into the array as they are read
from the user.  On the other hand, the arrays that hold the numbers that occur in the
questions have already been created and filled before <span class="code">administerQuiz()</span> is called.
Here's the subroutine:
</p>

<pre>private static void administerQuiz() {
    userAnswers = new int[10];
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
        int questionNum = i + 1;
        System.out.printf("Question %2d:  What is %2d + %2d  ? ",
                      questionNum, firstNumbers[i], secondNumbers[i]);
        userAnswers[i] = TextIO.getlnInt();
    }
}</pre>


<p>A couple notes about the output:  I wanted to number the questions
1, 2, ..., 10, but the elements of the arrays are numbered 0, 1, ..., 9.
This means that the question number that I output has to be one more than the
array index.  Also, all the numbers that occur in my program are either one or
two digits.  By allowing exactly two digits for each number in the output, I can
get everything to line up neatly.  Here's the I/O for a sample run of the
program:</p>

<pre>Welcome to the addition quiz!

Question  1:  What is 40 + 14  ? 54
Question  2:  What is 18 + 38  ? 46
Question  3:  What is 21 + 31  ? 52
Question  4:  What is 18 + 36  ? 54
Question  5:  What is 43 + 12  ? 55
Question  6:  What is 21 + 17  ? 38
Question  7:  What is 33 + 25  ? 58
Question  8:  What is 39 + 21  ? 70
Question  9:  What is  1 + 25  ? 26
Question 10:  What is 39 + 26  ? 65

Here are the correct answers:
   Question  1:  40 + 14  =  54.  You were CORRECT.
   Question  2:  18 + 38  =  56.  You said 46, which is INCORRECT.
   Question  3:  21 + 31  =  52.  You were CORRECT.
   Question  4:  18 + 36  =  54.  You were CORRECT.
   Question  5:  43 + 12  =  55.  You were CORRECT.
   Question  6:  21 + 17  =  38.  You were CORRECT.
   Question  7:  33 + 25  =  58.  You were CORRECT.
   Question  8:  39 + 21  =  60.  You said 70, which is INCORRECT.
   Question  9:   1 + 25  =  26.  You were CORRECT.
   Question 10:  39 + 26  =  65.  You were CORRECT.

You got 8 questions correct.
Your grade on the quiz is 80</pre>

<hr class="break">

<p>I noted in <a href="../c4/s3.html#subroutines.3.6">Subsection&nbsp;4.3.8</a> that it's considered bad style to use global
variables where parameters could be used instead, and that some people are quite hostile
to unnecessary global variables.  You might ask, how bad was it to use global variables in
this case?  To some extent this is a matter of opinion.  You could argue that the whole
program revolves around the three arrays, so it makes sense for them to be global in the
program.  On the other hand, it is possible to avoid using globals in this case.
The three array variables can be declared in <span class="code">main()</span> and the three arrays
can be created there and passed as parameters to the subroutines.  Here is a main
routine that does that:
</p>

<pre>public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] firstNums = new int[10];  // The first numbers in the ten problems
    int[] secondNums = new int[10]; // The second numbers in the ten problems
    int[] answers = new int[10];    // The user's answers.
    System.out.println();
    System.out.println("Welcome to the addition quiz!");
    System.out.println();
    createQuiz(firstNums,secondNums);
    administerQuiz(firstNums,secondNums,answers);
    gradeQuiz(firstNums,secondNums,answers);
}</pre>

<p>A complete second version of the program, with no global variables, is given below.
One reason that I asked you to use global variables is that understanding exactly how
arrays work as parameters requires an understanding of objects and how they are
passed as parameters.  Without that understanding, it's hard to get the global-less
version correct.  You will learn about passing objects as parameters in the
next chapter.</p>
