<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 4.4</h2>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 4.4:</h3>
<p>This exercise builds on <a href="../c4/ex3-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;4.3</a>.
Every time you roll the dice repeatedly, trying to get a given
total, the number of rolls it takes can be different. The question naturally
arises, what's the average number of rolls to get a given total? Write a function that performs the
experiment of rolling to get a given total 10000 times. The desired total is a
parameter to the subroutine. The average number of rolls is the return value.
Each individual experiment should be done by calling the function you wrote for
<a href="../c4/ex3-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;4.3</a>. Now, write a main program that will call your function once for
each of the possible totals (2, 3, ..., 12). It should make a table of the
results, something like:</p>


<pre>Total On Dice     Average Number of Rolls
-------------     -----------------------
       2               35.8382
       3               18.0607
       .                .
       .                .</pre>

<p>The solution uses the subroutine, <span class="code">rollFor</span>, from
<a href="../c4/ex3-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;4.3</a>.  That subroutine will throw an exception if
its parameter is not valid.  However, in my program, I <b>know</b> that the values
that I pass to the <span class="code">rollFor</span> subroutine are valid and that no
exception will occur.  So, there is no need to use a <span class="code">try..catch</span> statement
to handle the exception.</p>


<p>The <span class="code">main()</span> program simply prints a heading for the output, then
uses a <span class="code">for</span> loop to compute and print the data for each of the possible
rolls from 2 to 12. It is not difficult to write it, with a little care to get
the formatting right (using formatted output).</p>


<p>The only thing left is to write a function to find the average number of
rolls to get a given total on the dice. The average will be a real number, so
the return type of the function is <span class="ptype">double</span>. The subroutine has a
parameter of type <span class="ptype">int</span> that specifies the number we are rolling for.
I'll call the parameter "<span class="code">roll</span>". An algorithm for the subroutine is</p>


<pre>Let totalRolls = 0
Repeat 10000 times:
   Call rollFor(roll) to run the experiment once
   Add the returned value to totalRolls
Compute the average by dividing totalRolls by 10000
Return the average</pre>


<p>In my program, I use a <a href="../c4/s8.html#subroutines.7.2">named constant</a>, 
<span class="code">NUMBER_OF_EXPERIMENTS</span>, to
specify the number of experiments to be performed. This constant replaces the
value 10000, making it easier to read the program and easier to change the
number of experiments if I decide I want to do more experiments or fewer. This
gives the subroutine:</p>


<pre>public static double getAverageRollCount( int roll ) {
    int rollCountThisExperiment;  // Number of rolls in one experiment.
    int rollTotal;  // Total number of rolls in all the experiments.
    double averageRollCount;  // Average number of rolls per experiment.
    rollTotal = 0;
    for ( int i = 0;  i &lt; NUMBER_OF_EXPERIMENTS;  i++ ) {
       rollCountThisExperiment = rollFor( roll );
       rollTotal += rollCountThisExperiment;
    }
    averageRollCount = ((double)rollTotal) / NUMBER_OF_EXPERIMENTS;
    return averageRollCount;
}</pre>


<p>Note that when the average is computed, a type-cast is used to convert
<span class="code">rollTotal</span> to type <span class="ptype">double</span>. This is necessary since
<span class="code">rollCount</span> and <span class="code">NUMBER_OF_EXPERIMENTS</span> are integers, and the
computer would evaluate the quotient <span class="code">rollCount / NUMBER_OF_EXPERIMENTS</span>
as an integer.</p>


<p>By the way, this subroutine could be substantially abbreviated at the
expense of being somewhat less easy to understand:</p>


<pre>public static double getAverageRollCount( int roll ) {
    int rollTotal = 0;  // Total number of rolls in all the experiments.
    for ( int i = 0;  i &lt; NUMBER_OF_EXPERIMENTS;  i++ )
       rollTotal += rollFor( roll );
    return ((double)rollTotal) / NUMBER_OF_EXPERIMENTS;
}</pre>
