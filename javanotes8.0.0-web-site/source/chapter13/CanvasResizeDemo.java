/**
 * This class demos a Canvas that is resized when the Pane that
 * contains it is resized.  (The Pane changes size when the user
 * changes the window size.)  This is done by binding the
 * width property of the Canvas to the width property of the
 * Pane and the height property of the Canvas to the height
 * property of the Pane.
 * 
 * The program shows an animation of red disks bouncing around 
 * inside the canvas.  When the canvas size increases, the balls 
 * spread out into the new space.  When the canvas size decreases, 
 * the balls become trapped in the smaller space.  This shows
 * that the canvas really does change size.
