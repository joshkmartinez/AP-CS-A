/**
 * This program demonstrates how to do your own layout.  The root container
 * for the screen is a Pane, which will resize its children to their
 * preferred size, but will not set their location.  This program does
 * not do anything useful.
 *
 * The program sets the locations of a canvas that shows a checkerboard
 * and a label.  The Pane will set the size of the label.  Since a canvas
 * is not resizable, it is simply shown at its natural size.  Two
 * buttons are also shown.  They are set to be "unmanaged" which stops
 * any container from setting their size and positions.  This makes it
 * possible to set the size of the buttons as well as their locations.
