<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 9.1</h2>
<hr class="break">
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 9.1:</h3>
<p>In many textbooks, the first examples of recursion are
the mathematical functions <i>factorial</i> and <i>fibonacci</i>.  These functions
are defined for non-negative integers using the following recursive formulas:</p>

<pre>factorial(0)  =  1
factorial(N)  =  N*factorial(N-1)   for N &gt; 0

fibonacci(0)  =  1
fibonacci(1)  =  1
fibonacci(N)  =  fibonacci(N-1) + fibonacci(N-2)   for N &gt; 1</pre>

<p>Write recursive functions to compute <span class="code">factorial(N)</span> and
<span class="code">fibonacci(N)</span> for a given non-negative integer&nbsp;<span class="code">N</span>,
and write a <span class="code">main()</span> routine to test your functions. Consider
using the <span class="classname">BigInteger</span> class (see <a href="../c8/ex2-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;8.2</a>)</p>

<p>(In fact, <i>factorial</i> and <i>fibonacci</i> are really not very good
examples of recursion, since the most natural way to compute them is to use
simple <span class="code">for</span> loops.  Furthermore, <i>fibonacci</i> is a particularly
bad example, since the natural recursive approach to computing this function
is extremely inefficient.)</p>

<p>The recursive definitions of the two functions can be translated
rather easily into Java code.  Note that for <span class="code">factorial(N)</span>, the base
case is <span class="code">N=0</span>, while <span class="code">fibonacci(N)</span> has two base cases,
<span class="code">N=0</span> and <span class="code">N=1</span>.  The obvious recursive function for
computing <span class="code">fibonacci(N)</span> is:</p>

<pre>static int fibonacci( int N ) {
    if ( N == 0 || N == 1 ) {
           // Base cases; the answer is 1.
        return 1;
    }
    else {
           // Recursive case; the answer is obtained by applying the function
           // recursively to N-1 and to N-2, and adding the two answers.
        return fibonacci(N-1) + fibonacci(N-2);
    }
}</pre>

<p>and for <span class="code">factorial(N)</span> is</p>

<pre>static int factorial( int N ) {
   if ( N == 0) {
          // Base case; the answer is 1.
      return 1;
   }
   else {
         // Recursive case; the answer is obtained by applying the function
         // recursively to N-1 and multiplying the answer by N.
      return factorial(N-1) * N;
   }
}</pre>

<p>Adding a <span class="code">main()</span> routine that calls these methods for several values
of <span class="code">N</span> would be an acceptable solution to the exercise.  However, when testing
the program, you will quickly notice some problems.  First of all, the recursive algorithm
for <span class="code">fibonacci(N)</span> is so inefficient that it takes an unreasonably long
time for it to run even for values of <span class="code">N</span> as small as 40.  (In fact, the
recursive evaluation of <span class="code">fibonacci(N)</span> calls both <span class="code">fibonacci(N-1)</span>
and <span class="code">fibonacci(N-2)</span> and so takes almost twice as long as the evaluation
of <span class="code">fibonacci(N-1)</span>; with the computation time for <span class="code">fibonacci(N)</span>
almost doubling every time <span class="code">N</span> goes up by&nbsp;1, the computation time
quickly becomes unreasonable.)  Although I include
the recursive version of <span class="code">fibonacci</span> in my solution, my program refuses to
use this function if <span class="code">N</span> is greater than 40.</p>

<p>Another problem occurs because of the limited size of values of type <span class="code">int</span>.
The value of <span class="code">factorial(N)</span> grows very quickly as <span class="code">N</span> increases&mdash;so
quickly that by the time <span class="code">N</span> reaches 13, the value of <span class="code">factorial(N)</span>
is already too large to be expressed as a 32-bit integer!  So, the <span class="code">factorial</span>
function as defined above only gives the correct answer for numbers 0 through&nbsp;12.
Although <span class="code">fibonacci(N)</span> does not grow nearly so fast as <span class="code">factorial(N)</span>,
it is still true that by the time <span class="code">N</span> reaches 46, <span class="code">fibonacci(N)</span> is
outside the range of 32-bit integers.</p>

<p>The problem of the limited size of values of type <span class="ptype">int</span>
was discussed in <a href="../c8/s1.html#robustness.1.3">Subsection&nbsp;8.1.3</a>.  One approach to dealing with
the problem was presented in <a href="../c8/ex2-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;8.2</a>: The class <span class="code">java.math.BigInteger</span>
represents integer values that can be arbitrarily large (within the limits of the computer's
memory).  In my solution to the exercise, I decided to use <span class="classname">BigInteger</span>
values to compute <span class="code">factorial(N)</span> and to compute <span class="code">fibonacci(N)</span> non-recursively.
This allows my program to work even for fairly large values of <span class="code">N</span>, say up to
a few thousand.</p>

<p>You can read my solution below to see how I used the <span class="classname">BigInteger</span> class
and how I computed <span class="code">fibonacci(N)</span> non-recursively.</p>
