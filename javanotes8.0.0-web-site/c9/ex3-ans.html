<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 9.3:</h3>
<p>Suppose that linked lists
of integers are made from objects belonging to the class</p>


<pre>class ListNode {
   int item;       // An item in the list.
   ListNode next;  // Pointer to the next node in the list.
}</pre>


<p>Write a subroutine that will make a copy of a list, with the order of the
items of the list reversed. The subroutine should have a parameter of type
<span class="classname">ListNode</span>, and it should return a value of type <span class="classname">ListNode</span>. The
original list should not be modified.</p>


<p>You should also write a <span class="code">main()</span> routine to test your subroutine.</p>

<p>To make any linked list from scratch, you have to create nodes one-by-one
and link them together. In this case, we want to make nodes that contain copies
of the items from the original list. We can run through the original list, look
at each item, create a new node that contains a copy of that item, and link
that new node into the reversed list that we are constructing. We just have to
make sure that the nodes in the new list are in the desired order.</p>


<p>In fact this is pretty easy: As we run down the original list from start to
finish, we need to build the reversed list from back to front. The first item
in the original list should be at the back of the reversed list, the second
item from the original goes in front of that item, and so on. This is
equivalent to "pushing" the items onto the reversed list, using the same push
operation that is used for a stack. An algorithm for this is:</p>


<pre>Let rev be an empty list
for each item in the original list:
    Push the item onto rev
    Move on to the next item</pre>


<p>This can be coded into the subroutine we need as follows:</p>


<pre>/**
 * Return a new list containing the same items as the list,
 * but in the reverse order.
 */
static ListNode reverse( ListNode list ) {
   ListNode rev = null;     // rev will be the reversed list.
   ListNode runner = list;  // For running through the nodes of list.
   while (runner != null) {
          // "Push" the next node of list onto the front of rev.
      ListNode newNode = new ListNode();
      newNode.item = runner.item;
      newNode.next = rev;
      rev = newNode;
         // Move on to the next node in the list.
      runner = runner.next; 
   }
   return rev;
} // end reverse()</pre>


<p>The exercise lets you design your own routine for testing the subroutine. It
should be tested on several lists, including an empty list. It's important to
test it on the empty list since a <span class="code">null</span> pointer often represents a
special case in an algorithm, and is therefore a common source of bugs. It's also a
good idea to test a list of length one, for similar reasons. In my
<span class="code">main()</span> routine, I build up a random list one node at a time and test
the <span class="code">reverse()</span> subroutine on the list at each step. The <span class="code">main()</span>
routine was probably harder to write than the subroutine!</p>
