<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 9.2</h2>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 9.2:</h3>
<p>
<a href="../c7/ex6-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;7.6</a> asked you to read a file, make an 
alphabetical list of all the words that occur in the file, and write the list to another
file.  In that exercise, you were asked to use an <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</span> to
store the words.  Write a new version of the same program that stores the words
in a binary sort tree instead of in an arraylist.  You can use the binary sort tree
routines from <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter9/SortTreeDemo.java">SortTreeDemo.java</a></span>, which was discussed in 
<a href="../c9/s4.html#recursion.4.2">Subsection&nbsp;9.4.2</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>In my solution to <a href="../c7/ex6-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;7.6</a>, words are added to an
arraylist in the order in which they are encountered.  After the file has been
completely read, the arraylist is sorted into alphabetical order before the list of
words is printed.   Since a binary sort tree is
designed to store words in alphabetical order at all times, there is no need
for sorting.   At the end of the program, an inorder traversal of the tree can
be used to output the words to the file.   Using an inorder traversal guarantees
that the words will be output in increasing order.</p>


<p>For my solution to this exercise, I copied the routines <span class="code">treeInsert</span>,
<span class="code">treeContains</span>, and <span class="code">countNodes</span> from <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter9/SortTreeDemo.java">SortTreeDemo.java</a></span>.
I also copied the declaration of <span class="code">root</span> as a static member variable, since
that's the variable that represents the tree itself.  (It's unfortunate that <span class="code">root</span>
has to be a global variable rather than a local variable in <span class="code">main()</span>, 
but it's used as a global variable in the <span class="code">treeInsert</span> routine.  A better solution
to the exercise would define a <span class="classname">BinarySortTree</span> class to
encapsulate the data and routines needed to represent the tree and to use a variable of type
<span class="classname">BinarySortTree</span> in the program.)</p>
   

<p>Only a few changes are needed in the <span class="code">main()</span> routine of the original program. They are
shown in red in the solution given below. All-in-all, the substitution of the binary tree 
for the arraylist is very straightforward.</p>
