<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 9.4</h2>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 9.4:</h3>
<p>
<a href="../c9/s4.html#recursion.4.1">Subsection&nbsp;9.4.1</a> 
explains how to use recursion to print out the items in a binary tree
in various orders. That section also notes that a non-recursive subroutine can
be used to print the items, provided that a stack or queue is used as an
auxiliary data structure. Assuming that a queue is used, here is an algorithm
for such a subroutine:</p>

<pre>Add the root node to an empty queue
while the queue is not empty:
   Get a node from the queue
   Print the item in the node
   if node.left is not null:
      add it to the queue
   if node.right is not null:
      add it to the queue</pre>

<p>Write a subroutine that implements this algorithm, and write a program to
test the subroutine. Note that you will need a queue of <span class="classname">TreeNodes</span>, so
you will need to write a class to represent such queues.</p>

<p>(Note that the order in which items are printed by this algorithm is different
from all three of the orders considered in <a href="../c9/s4.html#recursion.4.1">Subsection&nbsp;9.4.1</a>.)</p>

<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr>
<p>There's really not a lot to think about here, since such a complete
algorithm is given. However, we do have to assemble the pieces. I use the
standard binary tree node from <a href="../c9/s4.html">Section&nbsp;9.4</a> (except that
I changed the name of the tree node class to <span class="classname">StrTreeNode</span>). The
algorithm needs a queue of tree nodes. To implement this, I copied the
<span class="classname">QueueOfInts</span> class from <a href="../c9/s3.html#recursion.3.2">Subsection&nbsp;9.3.2</a> and changed
the type of the items in the queue to <span class="classname">StrTreeNode</span>. I also changed the
name to <span class="classname">TreeQueue</span>. I did this literally by copying the class from a
Web browser window and pasting it into my source code file. With these classes
in hand, the algorithm given in the exercise can be coded as:</p>


<pre>/**
 * Use a queue to print all the strings in the tree to which
 * root points.  (The nodes will be listed in "level order",
 * that is:  first the root, then children of the root, then
 * grandchildren of the root, and so on.)
 */
static void levelOrderPrint(StrTreeNode root) {
    if (root == null)
       return;  // There is nothing to print in an empty tree.
    TreeQueue queue;   // The queue.
    queue = new TreeQueue();
    queue.enqueue(root);
    while ( queue.isEmpty() == false ) {
       StrTreeNode node = queue.dequeue();
       System.out.println( node.item );
       if ( node.left != null )
          queue.enqueue( node.left );
       if ( node.right != null )
          queue.enqueue( node.right );
    }
} // end levelOrderPrint()</pre>


<p>The name of this routine comes from the order in which it prints out the
nodes of the tree. Think of the root of the tree as being on the top "level" of
the tree, the children of the root on the second level, the children of the
children of the root on the third level, and so on. Then the subroutine prints
the items in <span class="newword">level order</span>. That is, all the nodes
on one level are printed before any of the nodes on the next level. This is a
consequence of the way the algorithm processes the items. As items from one
level are removed from the queue and printed, their children (which are the
nodes on the next level) are added to the <b>back</b> of the queue. Just after
all the items from one level have been processed, the queue contains all the
children of those items, ready to be processed, and those children are
exactly the nodes on the next level of the tree. Level-order tree
traversals can't be done by recursion, and they are a standard application of
queues.</p>


<p>To test my subroutine, I wanted a reasonably large tree whose structure I
knew, so I could check whether the nodes are printed in the correct order.
(Since you didn't know about level-order traversals until now, on the other
hand, you should have been mainly concerned with checking that all the nodes in
the tree are printed, period.) I decided to create the binary sort tree shown
in <a href="../c9/s4.html#recursion.4.2">Subsection&nbsp;9.4.2</a>. To do this, I copied the
<span class="code">treeInsert()</span>subroutine from that section and used it to add names to
the tree in an order that would produce the tree I wanted. Finally, I called
<span class="code">levelOrderPrint()</span> to output the names from the tree. (It worked!)</p>


<p>By the way, you might notice that the <span class="code">levelOrderPrint()</span> routine is
very similar to the technique used in the grid-marking algorithm in the sample program
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter9/DepthBreadth.java">DepthBreadth.java</a></span> from
<a href="../c9/s3.html#recursion.3.2">Subsection&nbsp;9.3.2</a>. In fact they are just variations on the same idea.
One difference is that in <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter9/DepthBreadth.java">DepthBreadth.java</a></span>, the squares of the grid had to be
marked as "visited" as they were processed to avoid going into an infinite
loop. The <span class="code">levelOrderPrint()</span> subroutine doesn't have to do the same
type of marking because it is working on a tree. One of the defining properties
of a tree is that it cannot contain a loop of nodes. That is, it is not
possible for a node to be its own descendant. This restriction guarantees that
<span class="code">levelOrderPrint()</span> will not go into an infinite loop. The same property
guarantees that all of our recursive tree-processing methods will not suffer
from infinite recursion when they are applied to a tree. You should note,
however, that it is possible to connect tree nodes into data structures that
contain loops and are therefore not trees at all. 
While these data structures are not trees, they might have other
uses. Many of the subroutines we've looked will fail if applied to these loopy
structures.</p>
