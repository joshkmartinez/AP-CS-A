<h2 class="quiz_title">Quiz on Chapter 9</h2>
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> questions on Chapter 9 of
           <a href="../index.html"><i>Introduction to Programming Using Java</i></a>.
           You should be able to answer these questions after studying that chapter.
           Sample answers to these questions can be found <a href="quiz_answers.html">here</a>.</p>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;1:</p>
<p>Explain what is meant by a <i>recursive</i> subroutine.</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;2:</p>
<p>Consider the following subroutine:</p>

<pre>static void printStuff(int level) {
    if (level == 0) {
       System.out.print("*");
    }
    else {
       System.out.print("[");
       printStuff(level - 1);
       System.out.print(",");
       printStuff(level - 1);
       System.out.print("]");
    }
}</pre>

<p>Show the output that would be produced by the subroutine calls
<span class="code">printStuff(0)</span>, <span class="code">printStuff(1)</span>, <span class="code">printStuff(2)</span>, and
<span class="code">printStuff(3)</span>.</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;3:</p>
<p>Suppose that a linked list
is formed from objects that belong to the class</p>

<pre>class ListNode {
   int item;       // An item in the list.
   ListNode next;  // Pointer to next item in the list.
}</pre>

<p>Write a subroutine that will count the number of zeros that occur in a given
linked list of <span class="ptype">ints</span>. The subroutine should have a parameter of type <span class="code">ListNode</span>
and should return a value of type <span class="ptype">int</span>.</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;4:</p>
<p>Let <span class="classname">ListNode</span> be defined as in the previous
problem.  Suppose that <span class="code">head</span> is a variable of type
<span class="classname">ListNode</span> that points to the first node in a
linked list.  Write a code segment that will add the number 42 in a new
node at the <b>end</b> of the list.  Assume that the list is not empty.
(There is no "tail pointer" for the list.)</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;5:</p>
<p>What are the three operations on a <i>stack?</i>
</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;6:</p>
<p>What is the basic difference
between a stack and a queue?</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;7:</p>
<p>What is an <i>activation
record</i>? What role does a stack of activation records play in a
computer?</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;8:</p>
<p>Suppose that a binary tree of integers
is formed from objects belonging to the class</p>

<pre>class TreeNode {
   int item;       // One item in the tree.
   TreeNode left;  // Pointer to the left subtree.
   TreeNode right; // Pointer to the right subtree.
}</pre>

<p>Write a recursive subroutine that will find the sum of all the nodes in the
tree. Your subroutine should have a parameter of type <span class="code">TreeNode</span>, and it
should return a value of type <span class="ptype">int</span>.</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;9:</p>
<p>Let <span class="classname">TreeNode</span> be the same class as in the previous
problem.  Write a recursive subroutine that makes a copy of a binary tree.
The subroutine has a parameter that points to the root of the tree that is
to be copied.  The return type is <span class="classname">TreeNode</span>,
and the return value should be a pointer to the root of the copy.
The copy should consist of newly created nodes, and it should have exactly
the same structure as the original tree.
</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;10:</p>
<p>What is a <i>postorder traversal</i> of a binary tree?</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;11:</p>
<p>Suppose that a <span class="code">&lt;multilist&gt;</span> is defined by the BNF rule</p>

<pre>&lt;multilist&gt;  ::=  &lt;word&gt;  |  "(" [ &lt;multilist&gt; ]... ")"</pre>

<p>where a <span class="code">&lt;word&gt;</span> can be any sequence of letters. Give five
different <span class="code">&lt;multilist&gt;'s</span> that can be generated by this rule.
(This rule, by the way, is almost the entire syntax of the programming language
<span class="code">LISP</span>! <span class="code">LISP</span> is known for its simple syntax and its elegant and
powerful semantics.)</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;12:</p>
<p>Explain what is meant by <i>parsing</i> a computer program.</p>
