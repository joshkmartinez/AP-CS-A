<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 9.7:</h3>
<p>This exercise builds on
the previous exercise, <a href="../c9/ex6-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;9.6</a>. To
understand it, you should have some background in Calculus. The derivative of
an expression that involves the variable <span class="code">x</span> can be defined by a few
recursive rules:</p>


<ul>

<li>The derivative of a constant is 0.</li>


<li>The derivative of <span class="code">x</span> is 1.</li>


<li>If <span class="code">A</span> is an expression, let <span class="code">dA</span> be the derivative of
<span class="code">A</span>. Then the derivative of <span class="code">-A</span> is <span class="code">-dA</span>.</li>


<li>If <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> are expressions, let <span class="code">dA</span> be the
derivative of <span class="code">A</span> and let <span class="code">dB</span> be the derivative of <span class="code">B</span>.
Then the derivative of <span class="code">A+B</span> is <span class="code">dA+dB</span>.</li>


<li>The derivative of <span class="code">A-B</span> is <span class="code">dA-dB</span>.</li>


<li>The derivative of <span class="code">A*B</span> is <span class="code">A*dB + B*dA</span>.</li>


<li>The derivative of <span class="code">A/B</span> is <span class="code">(B*dA - A*dB) / (B*B)</span>.</li>

</ul>


<p>For this exercise, you should modify your program from the previous exercise
so that it can compute the derivative of an expression. You can do this by
adding a derivative-computing method to each of the node classes. First, add
another abstract method to the <span class="classname">ExpNode</span> class:</p>


<pre>abstract ExpNode derivative();</pre>


<p>Then implement this method in each of the four subclasses of
<span class="classname">ExpNode</span>. All the information that you need is in the rules given
above. In your main program, instead of printing the stack operations for the original 
expression, you should print out the stack operations that define the derivative.
Note that the formula that you get for the derivative can be much more
complicated than it needs to be. For example, the derivative of <span class="code">3*x+1</span>
will be computed as <span class="code">(3*1+0*x)+0</span>. This is correct, even though it's
kind of ugly, and it would be nice for it to be simplified.  However, simplifying
expressions is not easy.</p>


<p>As an alternative to printing out stack operations, you might want to print
the derivative as a fully parenthesized expression. You can do this by adding a
<span class="code">printInfix()</span> routine to each node class. It would be nice to leave
out unnecessary parentheses, but again, the problem of deciding which
parentheses can be left out without altering the meaning of the expression is a
fairly difficult one, which I don't advise you to attempt.</p>


<p>(There is one curious thing that happens here: If you apply the rules, as
given, to an expression tree, the result is no longer a tree, since the same
subexpression can occur at multiple points in the derivative. For example, if
you build a node to represent <span class="code">B*B</span> by saying "<span class="code">new
BinOpNode('*',B,B)</span>", then the left and right children of the new node are
actually the same node! This is not allowed in a tree. However, the difference
is harmless in this case since, like a tree, the structure that you get has no
loops in it. Loops, on the other hand, would be a disaster in most of the
recursive tree-processing subroutines that we have written, since it would
lead to infinite recursion.  The type of structure that is built by the
derivative functions is technically referred to as a <span class="newword">directed acyclic graph</span>.)</p>

<div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr>
<p>The solution to <a href="../c9/ex6-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;9.6</a> already
allows the variable x to occur in expressions. Since we are building on that
solution, no changes are needed in the parsing routines. There are a few easy
changes in the <span class="code">main()</span> routine, since it must take the derivative of
the expression entered by the user and then work with that derivative. The
changes are shown in the solution that is given below.</p>


<p>Aside from that, we only need to add the "<span class="code">ExpNode&nbsp;derivative()</span>"
method to each of the node classes. Since I want to print out the derivative in
fully parenthesized infix form, I also add another method, "<span class="code">void&nbsp;printInfix()</span>". 
Since this is not a required part of the exercise&mdash;and
since it's fairly simple to do&mdash;I won't discuss the <span class="code">printInfix()</span>
method further.</p>


<p>All the information that is needed for writing the <span class="code">derivative()</span>
methods is given in the derivative rules that are listed in the exercise. The
first three rules are pretty simple:</p>


<ul>

<li>Since the derivative of a constant is 0, the <span class="code">derivative()</span> method
in the <span class="classname">ConstNode</span> class has to return an <span class="classname">ExpNode</span> that
represents the expression "0". That's easy. We just need a constant node that
contains the number 0. The definition of <span class="code">derivative()</span> in the
<span class="classname">ConstNode</span> class is just: "<span class="code">return new ConstNode(0);</span>".</li>


<li>Similarly, the derivative of x is 1, so the definition of
<span class="code">derivative()</span> in the <span class="classname">VariableNode</span> class is "<span class="code">return new
ConstNode(1);</span>".</li>


<li>The derivative of <span class="code">-A</span> is <span class="code">-dA</span>, that is, it consists of a
unary minus operator applied to the derivative of the operand A. So, in the
<span class="classname">UnaryMinusNode</span> class, we have to compute the derivative of the
<span class="code">operand</span> and then create an <span class="classname">ExpNode</span> that applies a unary minus
to that derivative. The derivative of <span class="code">operand</span> is
<span class="code">operand.derivative()</span>, so we only need to "<span class="code">return new
UnaryMinusNode(operand.derivative());</span>".</li>

</ul>


<p>In the <span class="classname">BinOpNode</span> class, the derivative rule that we need to apply
depends on the value of the binary operator, <span class="code">+</span>, <span class="code">-</span>, <span class="code">*</span>, or&nbsp;<span class="code">/</span>.
The rules for <span class="code">A+B</span> and <span class="code">A-B</span> are easy to implement. Let's look
at the case of <span class="code">*</span>, where the rule is that the derivative of
<span class="code">A*B</span> is <span class="code">A*dB+B*dA</span>. In the <span class="classname">BinOpNode</span> class, <span class="code">A</span>
is the <span class="code">left</span> operand and <span class="code">B</span> is the right operand. We can
compute the derivatives <span class="code">dA</span> and <span class="code">dB</span> as
<span class="code">left.derivative()</span> and <span class="code">right.derivative()</span>. We then have to
build an expression tree to represent <span class="code">A*dB+B*dA</span>. We need one node to
represent the <span class="code">+</span> operation and two more nodes to represent the two <span class="code">*</span>
operations. We can create the tree step-by-step:</p>


<pre>ExpNode dA = left.derivative();
ExpNode dB = right.derivative();
ExpNode firstHalf = new BinOpNode('*', left, dB);   // A*dB
ExpNode secondHalf = new BinOpNode('*', right, dA); // B*dA
ExpNode answer = new BinOpNode('+', firstHalf, secondHalf);
return answer;  // This is the derivative we want!</pre>


<p>In my solution, however, I did the same thing in one statement:</p>


<pre>return new BinOpNode( '+',
                  new BinOpNode('*', left, right.derivative()),
                  new BinOpNode('*', right, left.derivative()) );</pre>


<p>This uses the fact that a constructor call is an expression and can be used
as an actual parameter in a subroutine. This statement returns a node that
represents the sum of two things. The first thing is a node that represents the
product of <span class="code">left</span> and <span class="code">right.derivative()</span>, and the second is a
node that represents the product of <span class="code">right</span> and
<span class="code">left.derivative()</span>. This is exactly the same thing that is returned by
the previous sequence of six statements. There are reasonable arguments for
doing things either way.</p>


<p>The rule for <span class="code">A/B</span> is even more complicated: <span class="code">(B*dA-A*dB)/(B*B)</span>. 
Nevertheless, using <span class="code">left</span> for <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">right</span>
for <span class="code">B</span>, I can compute the value with a single statement:</p>


<pre>return new BinOpNode( '/',
            new BinOpNode('-', 
                    new BinOpNode('*', right, left.derivative()),
                    new BinOpNode('*', left, right.derivative())),
            new BinOpNode('*', right, right) );</pre>


<p>As an exercise, you might try doing the same thing with a sequence of simple
statements.</p>

/*
    This program reads standard expressions typed in by the user. 
    The program constructs an expression tree to represent the
    expression.  <span class="newcode">It computes the derivative of the expression and
    prints out the derivative and the value of the derivative at
    several values of x.  It also prints out a list of commands 
    that could be used on a stack machine to evaluate the derivative.</span>
    The expressions can use the variable "x", positive real numbers, and
    the binary operators +, -, *, and /.  The unary minus operation
    is supported.  The expressions are defined by the BNF rules:

            &lt;expression&gt;  ::=  [ "-" ] &lt;term&gt; [ [ "+" | "-" ] &lt;term&gt; ]...

            &lt;term&gt;  ::=  &lt;factor&gt; [ [ "*" | "/" ] &lt;factor&gt; ]...

            &lt;factor&gt;  ::=  &lt;number&gt;  |  &lt;x-variable&gt; | "(" &lt;expression&gt; ")"

    A number must begin with a digit (i.e., not a decimal point).
    A line of input must contain exactly one such expression.  If extra
    data is found on a line after an expression has been read, it is
    considered an error.

    In addition to the main program class, SimpleParser5, this program
    defines a set of five nested classes for implementing expression trees.
