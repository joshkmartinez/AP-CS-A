<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 9.5</h2>

<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 9.5:</h3>
<p>In <a href="../c9/s4.html#recursion.4.2">Subsection&nbsp;9.4.2</a>, I say that "if the
[binary sort] tree is created by 
inserting items in a random order, there is a high probability that the tree 
is approximately balanced."
For this exercise, you will do an experiment to test whether that is true.</p>

<p>The <span class="newword">depth</span> of a node in a binary tree is the
length of the path from the root of the tree to that node. That is, the root
has depth 0, its children have depth 1, its grandchildren have depth 2, and so
on. In a balanced tree, all the leaves in the tree are about the same depth.
For example, in a perfectly balanced tree with 1023 nodes, all the leaves are
at depth 9. In an approximately balanced tree with 1023 nodes, the average
depth of all the leaves should be not too much bigger than 9.</p>

<p>On the other hand, even if the tree is approximately balanced, there might
be a few leaves that have much larger depth than the average, so we might also
want to look at the maximum depth among all the leaves in a tree.</p>

<p>For this exercise, you should create a random binary sort tree with 1023
nodes. The items in the tree can be real numbers, and you can create the tree
by generating 1023 random real numbers and inserting them into the tree, using
the usual <span class="code">treeInsert()</span> method for binary sort trees. Once you have the
tree, you should compute and output the average depth of all the leaves in the
tree and the maximum depth of all the leaves. To do this, you will need three
recursive subroutines: one to count the leaves, one to find the sum of the
depths of all the leaves, and one to find the maximum depth. The latter two
subroutines should have an <span class="ptype">int</span>-valued parameter, <span class="code">depth</span>, that
tells how deep in the tree you've gone. When you call this routine from the main
program, the <span class="code">depth</span> parameter is 0; when you call the routine recursively,
the parameter increases by 1.</p>

<hr>
<p>To create the tree, I copied the <span class="classname">TreeNode</span> class and the
<span class="classname">insertTree()</span> subroutine from <a href="../c9/s4.html#recursion.4.2">Subsection&nbsp;9.4.2</a>, and I
changed the type of the items in the tree from <span class="classname">String</span> to
<span class="ptype">double</span>. The main program uses a <span class="code">for</span> loop to add 1023 random
real numbers to the tree:</p>


<pre>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1023; i++)
    treeInsert(Math.random()); </pre>


<p>After that, it's just a matter of writing the routines described in the
exercise and calling them to get the desired statistics.</p>


<p>A routine for counting the leaves in the tree is similar to the
<span class="code">countNodes()</span> routine from <a href="../c9/s4.html#recursion.4.2">Subsection&nbsp;9.4.2</a>. That
routine, however, counts every node in the tree and now we only want to count
the leaves. A leaf is defined to be a node in which both the <span class="code">left</span> and
<span class="code">right</span> pointers are <span class="code">null</span>. In the recursion, one of the base
cases is when we come to a tree that consists of nothing but a leaf. In that
case, the number of leaves is 1. If the node is not a leaf, then we have to
count the number of leaves in each of its subtrees and add the results:</p>


<pre>/**
 * Return the number of leaves in the tree to which node points.
 */
static int countLeaves(TreeNode node) {
    if (node == null)
       return 0;  // An empty tree has no leaves.
    else if (node.left == null &amp;&amp; node.right == null)
       return 1;  // Node is a leaf.
    else
       return countLeaves(node.left) + countLeaves(node.right);
} // end countNodes()</pre>


<p>In general structure, the other two routines are similar. That is, there are
two base cases: an empty tree and a tree consisting just of a leaf. In the
remaining case&mdash;a node that has one or both subtrees non-empty&mdash;the routine
has to be applied recursively to the subtrees of the node. Look, for example,
at the routine for finding the sum of the depths of all the leaves in the
tree:</p>


<pre>/**
 * When called as sumOfLeafDepths(root,0), this will compute the
 * sum of the depths of all the leaves in the tree to which root
 * points.  When called recursively, the depth parameter gives
 * the depth of the node, and the routine returns the sum of the
 * depths of the leaves in the subtree to which node points.
 * In each recursive call to this routine, depth goes up by one.
 */
static int sumOfLeafDepths( TreeNode node, int depth ) {
    if ( node == null ) {
          // Since the tree is empty and there are no leaves,
          // the sum is zero.
       return 0;
    }
    else if ( node.left == null &amp;&amp; node.right == null) {
          // The node is a leaf, and there are no subtrees of node, so
          // the sum of the leaf depths is just the depth of this node.
       return depth;
    }
    else {
          // The node is not a leaf.  Return the sum of the
          // the depths of the leaves in the subtrees.
       return sumOfLeafDepths(node.left, depth + 1) 
                   + sumOfLeafDepths(node.right, depth + 1);
    }
} // end sumOfLeafDepth()</pre>


<p>The most interesting aspect of this routine is the way it uses its
<span class="code">depth</span> parameter, which is used to keep track of the depth of the
<span class="code">node</span> in the complete tree (not just the subtree to which <span class="code">node</span>
points). For the <span class="code">root</span>, the depth is 0. Each time the subroutine is
called recursively, the <span class="code">node</span> is one level deeper in the tree, and the
<span class="code">depth</span> parameter is correspondingly increased by 1. When we get down to
a leaf node, where <span class="code">node.left</span> and <span class="code">node.right</span> are
<span class="code">null</span>, the value of <span class="code">depth</span> is the depth of that node in the
original tree, and the sum of the depths of the leaves in the subtree, which
consists of just this one leaf node, is <span class="code">depth</span>. When <span class="code">node</span> is
not a leaf, the sums for the two subtrees of <span class="code">node</span> are computed
recursively and are added together to give the sum for all the leaves in the
whole subtree to which <span class="code">node</span> refers. (If you have trouble believing
that this works, remember that recursion works if it works for the base cases
and if it correctly breaks down big problems into smaller problems. You don't
have to follow the details.)</p>


<p>The routine for computing the maximum depth is similar.</p>


<p>When I ran my program several times, I found that the average depth of the
leaves in the tree tended to be about 12&mdash;higher than I expected but still
only 1/3 more than the average depth in a perfectly balanced tree. The height
of the tree tended to be about 20.  (The <span class="newword">height</span> of a
tree is defined to be the maximum depth of any node in the tree.)</p>
