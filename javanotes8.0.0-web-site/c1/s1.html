<hr class="break">


<p>
<span class="start"><big>A</big> computer is a complex system</span> consisting of many
different components. But at the heart&mdash;or the brain, if you want&mdash;of the
computer is a single component that does the actual computing. This is the
<span class="newword">Central Processing Unit</span>, or CPU. In a modern
desktop computer, the CPU is a single "chip" on the order of one square inch in
size. The job of the CPU is to execute programs.</p>


<p>A <span class="newword">program</span> is simply a list of unambiguous
instructions meant to be followed mechanically by a computer. A computer is
built to carry out instructions that are written in a very simple type of
language called <span class="newword">machine language</span>. Each type of
computer has its own machine language, and the computer can directly execute a program
only if the program is expressed in that language. (It can execute programs written in
other languages if they are first translated into machine language.)</p>


<p>When the CPU executes a program, that program is stored in the computer's
<span class="newword">main memory</span> (also called the RAM or random access
memory). In addition to the program, memory can also hold data that is being
used or processed by the program. Main memory consists of a sequence of
<span class="newword">locations</span>. These locations are numbered, and the
sequence number of a location is called its <span class="newword">address</span>.
An address provides a way of picking out one
particular piece of information from among the millions stored in memory. When
the CPU needs to access the program instruction or data in a particular
location, it sends the address of that information as a signal to the memory;
the memory responds by sending back the value contained in the specified
location. The CPU can also store information in memory by specifying the
information to be stored and the address of the location where it is to be
stored.</p>


<p>On the level of machine language, the operation of the CPU is fairly
straightforward (although it is very complicated in detail). The CPU executes a
program that is stored as a sequence of machine language instructions in main
memory. It does this by repeatedly reading, or <span class="newword">fetching</span>,
an instruction from memory and then carrying out, or
<span class="newword">executing</span>, that instruction. This process&mdash;fetch
an instruction, execute it, fetch another instruction, execute it, and so on
forever&mdash;is called the <span class="newword">fetch-and-execute cycle</span>.
With one exception, which will be covered in the <a href="../c1/s2.html">next&nbsp;section</a>, 
this is all that the CPU ever does.  (This is all really somewhat more complicated in modern
computers.  A typical processing chip these days contains several CPU "cores," which allows
it to execute several instructions simultaneously.  And access to main memory is speeded up
by memory "caches," which can be more quickly accessed than main memory and which are meant to hold
data and instructions that the CPU is likely to need soon.  However, these complications
don't change the basic operation.)</p>


<p>A CPU contains an <span class="newword">Arithmetic Logic Unit</span>, or ALU, which is the part of
the processor that carries out operations such as addition and subtraction.  It also holds
a small number of <span class="newword">registers</span>, which are small memory units capable of
holding a single number.  A typical CPU might have 16 or 32 "general purpose" registers,
which hold data values that are immediately accessible for processing, and many machine
language instructions refer to these registers.  For example, there might be an instruction
that takes two numbers from two specified registers, adds those numbers (using the ALU), and stores the
result back into a register.  And there might be instructions for copying a data value from
main memory into a register, or from a register into main memory.
</p>


<p>The CPU also includes special purpose registers.  The most important of these is
the <span class="newword">program counter</span>, or PC.  The CPU uses the PC to
keep track of where it is in the program it is executing. The PC simply stores the
memory address of the next instruction that the CPU should execute. At the beginning
of each fetch-and-execute cycle, the CPU checks the PC to see which instruction
it should fetch. During the course of the fetch-and-execute cycle, the number
in the PC is updated to indicate the instruction that is to be executed in the
next cycle. Usually, but not always, this is just the instruction that
sequentially follows the current instruction in the program.  Some machine language
instructions modify the value that is stored in the PC.  This makes it possible
for the computer to "jump" from one point in the program to another point, which
is essential for implementing the program features known as loops and branches
that are discussed in <a href="../c1/s4.html">Section&nbsp;1.4</a>.
</p>



<hr class="break">


<p>A computer executes machine language programs mechanically&mdash;that is
without understanding them or thinking about them&mdash;simply because of the way
it is physically put together. This is not an easy concept. A computer is a
machine built of millions of tiny switches called <span class="newword">transistors</span>, 
which have the property that they can be wired
together in such a way that an output from one switch can turn another switch
on or off. As a computer computes, these switches turn each other on or off in
a pattern determined both by the way they are wired together and by the program
that the computer is executing.</p>


<p>Machine language instructions are expressed as binary numbers. A binary
number is made up of just two possible digits, zero and one.  Each zero or
one is called a <span class="newword">bit</span>.  So, a machine
language instruction is just a sequence of zeros and ones. Each particular
sequence encodes some particular instruction. The data that the computer
manipulates is also encoded as binary numbers.  In modern computers, each
memory location holds a <span class="newword">byte</span>, which is a sequence of eight
bits.  A machine language instruction or a piece of data generally
consists of several bytes, stored in consecutive memory locations.
For example, when a CPU reads an instruction from memory, it might actually
read four or eight bytes from four or eight memory locations; the memory address
of the instruction is the address of the first of those bytes.
</p>


<p>A computer can work directly
with binary numbers because switches can readily represent such numbers: Turn
the switch on to represent a one; turn it off to represent a zero. Machine
language instructions are stored in memory as patterns of switches turned on or
off. When a machine language instruction is loaded into the CPU, all that
happens is that certain switches are turned on or off in the pattern that
encodes that instruction. The CPU is built to respond to this
pattern by executing the instruction it encodes; it does this simply because of
the way all the other switches in the CPU are wired together.</p>


<p>So, you should understand this much about how computers work: Main memory
holds machine language programs and data. These are encoded as binary numbers.
The CPU fetches machine language instructions from memory one after another and
executes them.  Each instruction makes the CPU perform some very small task,
such as adding two numbers or moving data to or from memory.
The CPU does all this mechanically, without thinking about or
understanding what it does&mdash;and therefore the program it executes must be
perfect, complete in all details, and unambiguous because the CPU can do
nothing but execute it exactly as written. Here is a schematic view of this
first-stage understanding of the computer:</p>
