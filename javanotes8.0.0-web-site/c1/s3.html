<span class="start"><big>M</big>achine language consists</span> of very simple
instructions that can be executed directly by the CPU of a computer. Almost all
programs, though, are written in <span class="newword">high-level programming languages</span> 
such as Java, Python, or C++. A program written in a
high-level language cannot be run directly on any computer. First, it has to be
translated into machine language. This translation can be done by a program
called a <span class="newword">compiler</span>. A compiler takes a
high-level-language program and translates it into an executable
machine-language program. Once the translation is done, the machine-language
program can be run any number of times, but of course it can only be run on one
type of computer (since each type of computer has its own individual machine
language). If the program is to run on another type of computer it has to be
re-translated, using a different compiler, into the appropriate machine
language.</p>


<p>There is an alternative to compiling a high-level language program. Instead
of using a compiler, which translates the program all at once, you can use an
<span class="newword">interpreter</span>, which translates it
instruction-by-instruction, as necessary. An interpreter is a program that acts
much like a CPU, with a kind of fetch-and-execute cycle. In order to execute a
program, the interpreter runs in a loop in which it repeatedly reads one
instruction from the program, decides what is necessary to carry out that
instruction, and then performs the appropriate machine-language commands to do
so.</p>


<p>(A compiler is like a human translator who translates an entire book from
one language to another, producing a new book in the second language.
An interpreter is more like a human interpreter who translates a speech at
the United Nations from one language to another at the same time that
the speech is being given.)</p>


<p>One use of interpreters is to execute high-level language programs. For
example, the programming language Lisp is usually executed by an interpreter
rather than a compiler. However, interpreters have another purpose: They can
let you use a machine-language program meant for one type of computer on a
completely different type of computer. For example, one of the original home
computers was the Commodore&nbsp;64 or "C64".  While you might not find an actual
C64, you can find programs that run on other computers&mdash;or even in
a web browser&mdash;that "emulate" one.  Such an emulator can run C64 programs by
acting as an interpreter for the C64 machine language.</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>The designers of Java chose to use a combination of compiling and
interpreting. Programs written in Java are compiled into machine language,
but it is a machine language for a computer that doesn't really exist. This
so-called "virtual" computer is known as the <span class="newword">Java Virtual Machine</span>,
or JVM.
The machine language for the Java Virtual Machine is called
<span class="newword">Java bytecode</span>.  There is no reason why Java
bytecode couldn't be used as the machine language of a real computer, rather
than a virtual computer.  But in fact the use of a virtual machine makes possible
one of the main selling points of Java: the fact that it can actually be
used on <b>any</b> computer. All that the computer needs is an interpreter for
Java bytecode. Such an interpreter simulates the JVM in the
same way that a C64 emulator simulates a Commodore&nbsp;64 computer.  (The term JVM is also used 
for the Java bytecode interpreter program that does the simulation, so we say that
a computer needs a JVM in order to run Java programs.  Technically, it would
be more correct to say that the interpreter <i>implements</i> the JVM than
to say that it <i>is</i> a JVM.)</p>


<p>Of course, a different Java bytecode interpreter is needed for each type of
computer, but once a computer has a Java bytecode interpreter, it can run any
Java bytecode program, and the same program can be run on any
computer that has such an interpreter. This is one of the essential features of
Java: the same compiled program can be run on many different types of
computers.</p>


<p align="center">

<p>Why, you might wonder, use the intermediate Java bytecode at all? Why not
just distribute the original Java program and let each person compile it into
the machine language of whatever computer they want to run it on? There are
several reasons. First of all, a compiler has to understand Java, a complex
high-level language. The compiler is itself a complex program. A Java bytecode
interpreter, on the other hand, is a relatively small, simple program. This makes
it easy to write a bytecode interpreter for a new type of computer; once that
is done, that computer can run any compiled Java program. It would be much
harder to write a Java compiler for the same computer.</p>


<p>Furthermore, some Java programs are meant to be downloaded over a network.
This leads to obvious security concerns: you don't want to download and run a
program that will damage your computer or your files. The bytecode interpreter
acts as a buffer between you and the program you download. You are really
running the interpreter, which runs the downloaded program indirectly. The
interpreter can protect you from potentially dangerous actions on the part of
that program.</p>


<p>When Java was still a new language, it was criticized for being slow:
Since Java bytecode was executed by an interpreter, it seemed that Java
bytecode programs could never run as quickly as programs compiled into
native machine language (that is, the actual
machine language of the computer on which the program is running).
However, this problem has been largely overcome by the use of <span class="newword">just-in-time
compilers</span> for executing Java bytecode.  A just-in-time compiler
translates Java bytecode into native machine language.  It does
this while it is executing the program.  Just as for a normal interpreter,
the input to a just-in-time compiler is a Java bytecode program, and its task
is to execute that program.  But as it is executing the program, it also
translates parts of it into machine language.  The translated parts of the
program can then be executed much more quickly than they could be interpreted.
Since a given part of a program is often executed many times as the program
runs, a just-in-time compiler can significantly speed up the overall 
execution time.
</p>


<p>I should note that there is no necessary connection between Java and Java
bytecode. A program written in Java could certainly be compiled into the
machine language of a real computer. And programs written in other languages
can be compiled into Java bytecode. However, the combination of Java
and Java bytecode is platform-independent, secure, and network-compatible
while allowing you to program in a modern high-level object-oriented
language.</p>


<p>In the past few years, it has become fairly common to create new programming
languages, or versions of old languages, that compile into Java bytecode.  The 
compiled bytecode programs can then be executed by a standard JVM.  New languages
that have been developed specifically for programming the JVM include Scala,
Groovy, Clojure, and Processing.  Jython and JRuby are versions of older languages,
Python and Ruby, that target the JVM.  These languages make it possible to
enjoy many of the advantages of the JVM while avoiding some of the technicalities
of the Java language.  In fact, the use of other languages with the JVM has
become important enough that several new features have been added to the
JVM specifically to add better support for some of those languages.  And this
improvement to the JVM has in turn made possible some new features in Java.</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>I should also note that the really hard part of platform-independence is
providing a "Graphical User Interface"&mdash;with windows, buttons, etc.&mdash;that
will work on all the platforms that support Java. You'll see more about this
problem in <a href="../c1/s6.html">Section&nbsp;1.6</a>.</p>
