<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 5.2:</h3>
<p>A common programming task
is computing statistics of a set of numbers. (A statistic is a number that
summarizes some property of a set of data.) Common statistics include the mean
(also known as the average) and the standard deviation (which tells how spread
out the data are from the mean). I have written a little class called
<span class="classname">StatCalc</span> that can be used to compute these statistics, as well as the
sum of the items in the dataset and the number of items in the dataset. You can
read the source code for this class in the file <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter5/StatCalc.java">StatCalc.java</a></span>.
If <span class="code">calc</span> is a variable of
type <span class="classname">StatCalc</span>, then the following instance methods are available:</p>


<ul>

<li>
<span class="code">calc.enter(item)&nbsp;</span> where
<span class="code">item</span> is a number, adds the item to the dataset.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">calc.getCount()&nbsp;</span> is a function
that returns the number of items that have been added to the dataset.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">calc.getSum()&nbsp;</span> is a function
that returns the sum of all the items that have been added to the dataset.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">calc.getMean()&nbsp;</span> is a function
that returns the average of all the items.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">calc.getStandardDeviation()&nbsp;</span> is
a function that returns the standard deviation of the items.</li>

</ul>


<p>Typically, all the data are added one after the other by calling the
<span class="code">enter()</span> method over and over, as the data become available. After all
the data have been entered, any of the other methods can be called to get
statistical information about the data. The methods <span class="code">getMean()</span> and
<span class="code">getStandardDeviation()</span> should only be called if the number of items is
greater than zero.</p>


<p>Modify the current source code, <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter5/StatCalc.java">StatCalc.java</a></span>, to add instance
methods <span class="code">getMax()</span> and <span class="code">getMin()</span>. The <span class="code">getMax()</span> method
should return the largest of all the items that have been added to the dataset,
and <span class="code">getMin()</span> should return the smallest. You will need to add two new
instance variables to keep track of the largest and smallest items that have
been seen so far.</p>


<p>Test your new class by using it in a program to compute statistics for a set
of non-zero numbers entered by the user. Start by creating an object of type
<span class="classname">StatCalc</span>:</p>


<pre>StatCalc  calc;   // Object to be used to process the data.
calc = new StatCalc();</pre>


<p>Read numbers from the user and add them to the dataset. Use 0 as a sentinel
value (that is, stop reading numbers when the user enters 0). After all the
user's non-zero numbers have been entered, print out each of the six statistics
that are available from <span class="code">calc</span>.</p>

<hr>
<div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr>

<p>For the <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> class to handle minimums and maximums, some of
what must be added to the class is obvious. We need two new instance
variables, <span class="code">min</span> and <span class="code">max</span>, and two getter methods to return the values
of those instance variables. So, we can add these lines to the class
definition:</p>


<pre>private double min;   // Smallest item that has been entered.
private double max;   // Largest item that has been entered.

public double getMin() {
   return min;
}

public double getMax() {
   return max;
}</pre>


<p>But then there is the problem of making sure that <span class="code">min</span> and
<span class="code">max</span> have the right values. <span class="code">min</span> records the smallest number
seen so far.  Every time we have a new number to add to
the dataset there is a possibility that <span class="code">min</span> will change, so
we have to compare <span class="code">min</span> with the newly added number. If the new number is
smaller than the current <span class="code">min</span>, then the number becomes the new value of
<span class="code">min</span> (since the new number is now the smallest number we have seen so
far). We do something similar for <span class="code">max</span>. This has to be done whenever a
number is entered into the dataset, so it has to be added to the
<span class="code">enter()</span> method, giving:</p>


<pre>public void enter(double num) {
      // This is not completely correct!
   count++;
   sum += num;
   squareSum += num*num;
   <span class="newcode">if (num &gt; max)          // We have a new maximum.
      max = num;
   if (num &lt; min)          // We have a new minimum.
      min = num;</span>
}</pre>


<p>Unfortunately, if this is all we do, there is a <b>bug in our
program</b>! For example, if the dataset consists of the numbers 21, 17,
and 4, the computer will insist that the minimum is 0, rather than 4. The
problem is that the variables <span class="code">min</span> and <span class="code">max</span> are initialized to
zero. (If no initial value is provided for a numerical instance variable, it
gets the default initial value, zero.) Since <span class="code">min</span> is 0, none of the
numbers in the dataset pass the test "<span class="code">if&nbsp;(num&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;min)</span>", and therefore the value
of <span class="code">min</span> never changes. A similar problem holds for <span class="code">max</span>, but it
will only show up if all the numbers in the dataset are less than zero. For the
other instance variables, <span class="code">count</span>, <span class="code">sum</span>, and <span class="code">squareSum</span>,
the default initial value of zero is correct. For <span class="code">min</span> and
<span class="code">max</span>, we have to do something different.</p>


<p>One possible way to fix the problem is to treat the first number entered as
a special case. When only one number has been entered, it's certainly the
largest number so far and also the smallest number so far, so it should be
assigned to both <span class="code">min</span> and <span class="code">max</span>. This can be handled in the
<span class="code">enter()</span> method:</p>


<pre>public void enter(double num) {
      // (This is NOT the version I used in my final answer.)
   count++;
   sum += num;
   squareSum += num*num;
   if (count == 1) {  // This is the first number.
      max = num;
      min = num;
   }
   else {
      if (num &gt; max)     // We have a new maximum.
         max = num;
      if (num &lt; min)     // We have a new minimum.
         min = num;
   }
}</pre>


<p>This works fine. However, I decided to use an alternative approach. We would
be OK if we could initialize <span class="code">min</span> to have a value that is bigger than
any possible number. Then, when the first number is entered, it definitely will
satisfy the test "<span class="code">if (num &lt; min)</span>", and therefore 
the first number will become the value of
<span class="code">min</span>. But to be "bigger than any possible number," <span class="code">min</span> would
have to be infinity. The initial value for <span class="code">max</span> has to be smaller than
any possible number, so <span class="code">max</span> has to be initialized to negative
infinity. And that's what we'll do!</p>


<p>Recall from <a href="../c2/s5.html">Section&nbsp;2.5</a> 
that the standard class <span class="classname">Double</span> contains constants
<span class="code">Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY</span> and <span class="code">Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY</span> that
represent positive and negative infinity.  We can
use these named constants to provide initial values for the instance variables
<span class="code">min</span> and <span class="code">max</span>. So, the declarations become:</p>


<pre>private double max = Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;  // Largest item seen.
private double min = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY;  // Smallest item seen.</pre>


<p>With this change, the <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> class works correctly. The complete
class is shown below.  (By the way, you might think about what happens if <span class="code">getMin()</span>
or <span class="code">getMax()</span> is called before any data has been entered.  What actually happens?
What should happen?  What is the minimum or maximum of a set of numbers that contains no
numbers at all?)</p>


<p>The main program is fairly straightforward, so just for fun I decided to
use a <span class="classname">Scanner</span> instead of <span class="classname">TextIO</span>
to read the user's input (see <a href="../c2/s4.html#basics.4.6">Subsection&nbsp;2.4.6</a>.
The user's data are read and
entered into the <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> object in a loop:</p>


<pre>do {
   System.out.print("? ");
   item = in.nextDouble();  // (in is the Scanner.)
   if (item != 0)
      calc.enter(item);
} while ( item != 0 );</pre>


<p>The subroutine call "<span class="code">calc.enter(item);</span>" enters the user's item.
That is, it does all the processing necessary to include this data item in the
statistics it is computing. After all the data have been entered, the
statistics can be obtained by using function calls such as
"<span class="code">calc.getMean()</span>". The statistics are output in statements such as:</p>


<pre>System.out.println("   Average:            " + calc.getMean());</pre>


<p>Note that a function call represents a value, and so can be used anyplace
where a variable or literal value could be used. I don't have to assign the
value of the function to a variable. I can use the function call directly in
the output statement.  Another note: In this program, I decided not to use
formatted output, since it seems appropriate to print the answers with
as much accuracy as possible.  For formatted output, the statement
used to print the mean could be something like:</p>


<pre>System.out.printf("    Average:            %10.3f%n", calc.getMean());</pre>


<p>The complete main program is shown below.</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>Although that completes the exercise, one might wonder: Instead of modifying
the source code of <span class="classname">StatCalc</span>, could we make a subclass of
<span class="classname">StatCalc</span> and put the modifications in that? The answer is yes. We will need
need to use the slightly obscure special variable <span class="code">super</span> that was
discussed in <a href="../c5/s6.html#OOP.6.2">Subsection&nbsp;5.6.2</a>.</p>


<p>The new instance variables and instance methods can simply be put into the
subclass. The problem arises with the <span class="code">enter()</span> method. We have to
redefine this method so that it will update the values of <span class="code">min</span> and
<span class="code">max</span>. But it also has to do all the processing that is done by the
original <span class="code">enter()</span> method in the <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> class. This is what
<span class="code">super</span> is for. It lets us call a method from the superclass of the
class we are writing. So, the subclass can be written:</p>


<pre>class StatCalcWithMinMax extends StatCalc {

   private double max = Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;  // Largest item seen.
   private double min = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY;  // Smallest item seen.

   public void enter(double num) {
      super.enter(num);  // Call the enter method from the StatCalc class.
      if (num &gt; max)  // Then do the extra processing for min and max.
         max = num;
      if (num &lt; min)
         min = num;
   }
 
   public double getMin() {
      return min;
   }
   
   public double getMax() {
      return max;
   }

}  // end class StatCalcWithMinMax</pre>
