<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 5.7</h2>
<hr class="break">
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 5.7:</h3>
<p>Rewrite the program from the <a href="../c5/ex6-ans.html">previous exercise</a>
so that it administers a quiz with several different kinds of questions.
In the previous exercise, you used
a class to represent addition questions.  For this exercise, you will use the following <span class="code">interface</span>,
or an equivalent abstract class, to represent the more general idea of a question that has
an integer as its answer:</p>

<pre>public interface IntQuestion {
    public String getQuestion();
    public int getCorrectAnswer();
}</pre>

<p>You can make the <span class="classname">AdditionQuestion</span> class implement the interface
simply by adding "<span class="code">implements IntQuestion</span>" to its definition.  Write a similar
class to represent subtraction questions.  When creating a subtraction problem, you should make
sure that the answer is not negative.</p>

<p>For the new program, use an array of type <span class="atype">IntQuestion[]</span> to hold the quiz
questions.  Include some addition questions and some subtraction questions in the quiz.
You can also add a couple non-math questions, including this one, created as an anonymous class:</p>

<pre>IntQuestion bigQuestion = new IntQuestion() {
    public String getQuestion() {
        return "What is the answer to the ultimate question " +
                 " of life, the universe, and everything?";
    }
    public int getCorrectAnswer() {
        return 42;
    }
};</pre>

<p>Where the solution to the previous exercise used an
array of <span class="classname">AdditionQuestion</span> to store addition problems,
the new program has to store questions of various types. An array of type
<span class="atype">IntQuestion[]</span> can hold any object that implements the
<span class="classname">IntQuestion</span> interface.  That includes 
objects of type <span class="classname">AdditionQuestion</span> as long as we modify that
class so that it implements <span class="classname">IntQuestion</span>.  But it can also
include other types of objects.  For one thing, we want to have subtraction 
problems.  We can implement subtraction with a class very similar to the class
for addition questions:</p>

<pre>class SubtractionQuestion implements IntQuestion {
    private int a, b;  // The numbers in the problem.
    public SubtractionQuestion() { // constructor
       a = (int)(Math.random() * 50 + 1);
       b = (int)(Math.random() * 50);
       <span class="newcode">if (a - b &lt; 0) { // swap a and b so answer won't be negative
          int temp = a;
          a = b;
          b = temp;
       }</span>
   }
   public String getQuestion() {
       return "What is " + a + " - " + b + " ?";
    }
    public int getCorrectAnswer() {
       return a - b;
   }
}</pre>

<p>The exercise asks for subtraction problems for which the answer is not negative.
There are a number of ways to accomplish that.  For example, you could use a loop
that would continue selecting random values for <span class="code">a</span> and <span class="code">b</span>
as long as <span class="code">a&nbsp;-&nbsp;b&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0</span>.  You could choose
<i>b</i> and the <i>answer</i> randomly and then compute <i>a</i> as
<span class="code">a&nbsp;=&nbsp;answer&nbsp;+&nbsp;b</span>. In my solution, I just swap
the values of <span class="code">a</span> and <span class="code">b</span> when <span class="code">a&nbsp;-&nbsp;b&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0</span>.</p>

<p>Creating the quiz becomes a more difficult problem in the new version, since
we need to use several different kinds of questions.  In my solution, the first seven
questions are math problems.  For each math problem, the program decides randomly whether
to make it an addition question or a subtraction question.  The last three questions
are created using anonymous classes, just like the example given in the exercise.
You can see my solution below.</p>

<p>But the three anonymous classes in my solution have a lot in common: They are the same except for
the particular string that is used to ask the question and the particular number
that is the correct answer.  A better approach would probably have been to create 
a class to represent such questions:</p>

<pre>public class GeneralQuestion implements IntQuestion {
    private String question;
    private int answer;
    public GeneralQuestion( String question, int answer ) {
        this.question = question;
        this.answer = answer;
    }
    public String getQuestion() {
        return question;
    }
    public int getCorrectAnswer() {
        return answer;
    }
}</pre>

<p>In that case, the subroutine for creating the quiz would become:</p>

<pre>private static void createQuiz() {
    questions = new IntQuestion[10];
    for ( int i = 0; i &lt; 7; i++ ) {
        if (Math.random() &lt; 0.5)
            questions[i] = new AdditionQuestion();
        else
            questions[i] = new SubtractionQuestion();
    }
    questions[7] = new GeneralQuestion("How many states are there in the United States?",50);
    questions[8] = new GeneralQuestion("In what year did the First World War begin?",1914);
    questions[9] = new GeneralQuestion("What is the answer to the ultimate question " +
                                "of life, the universe, and everything?",42);
}</pre>

<p>Aside from the declaration of the array <span class="code">questions</span> 
and the routine for creating the quiz, everything else in the program can be exactly as
it was in the previous exercise.  (However, I did change the format of the output in
<span class="code">gradeQuiz()</span> to make it look better for longer questions.)</p>

<p>In my solution, just to keep everything in one file, I nested the interface 
and the two classes that implement it inside the main program class.  It would probably be
better style to put them all in their own files.</p>
