<p>Some object-oriented programming languages, such as C++, allow a class to
extend two or more superclasses. This is called <span class="newword">multiple inheritance</span>. 
In the illustration below, for example, class&nbsp;E is shown as
having both class&nbsp;A and class&nbsp;B as direct superclasses, while class&nbsp;F has three
direct superclasses.</p>


<p align="center">

<p>Such multiple inheritance is <b>not</b> allowed in Java. The
designers of Java wanted to keep the language reasonably simple, and felt that
the benefits of multiple inheritance were not worth the cost in increased
complexity. However, Java does have a feature that can be used to accomplish
many of the same goals as multiple inheritance: <span class="newword">interfaces</span>.
We have already encountered "functional interfaces" in <a href="../c4/s5.html">Section&nbsp;4.5</a>
in connection with lambda expressions.  A functional interface specifies
a single method.  However, interfaces can be much more complicated than
that, and they have many other uses.
</p>


<p>You are not likely to need to write your own interfaces until you get to the
point of writing fairly complex programs. However, there are several interfaces
that are used in important ways in Java's standard packages, and you will need
to learn how to use them.</p>



<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="OOP.7.1">5.7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Defining and Implementing Interfaces</a>
</h3>



<p>We encountered the term "interface" in other contexts, in connection with black
boxes in general and subroutines in particular. The interface of a subroutine
consists of the name of the subroutine, its return type, and the number and
types of its parameters. This is the information you need to know if you want
to call the subroutine. A subroutine also has an implementation: the block of
code which defines it and which is executed when the subroutine is called.</p>


<p>In Java, <span class="code">interface</span> is a reserved word with an additional, technical
meaning. An "<span class="code">interface</span>" in this sense consists of a set of instance method
interfaces, without any associated implementations.  (Actually, a Java interface
can contain other things as well, as we'll see later.)
A class can <span class="newword">implement</span> 
an <span class="code">interface</span> by providing an implementation
for each of the methods specified by the interface. Here is an example of a
very simple Java <span class="code">interface</span>:</p>


<pre>public interface Strokeable {
   public void stroke(GraphicsContext g);
}</pre>


<p>This looks much like a class definition, except that the implementation of
the <span class="code">stroke()</span> method is omitted. A class that implements the
<span class="code">interface</span> <span class="classname">Strokeable</span> must provide an implementation for
<span class="code">stroke()</span>. Of course, the class can also include other methods and variables. For
example,</p>


<pre>public class Line implements Strokeable {
    public void stroke(GraphicsContext g) {
        . . . // do something&mdash;presumably, draw a line
    }
    . . . // other methods, variables, and constructors
}</pre>


<p>Note that to implement an interface, a class must do more than simply provide
an implementation for each method in the interface; it must also <b>state</b> that
it implements the interface, using the reserved word <span class="code">implements</span> as
in this example: "<span class="code">public class Line <b>implements</b> Strokeable</span>".
Any concrete class that implements the <span class="classname">Strokeable</span> interface must define a
<span class="code">stroke()</span> instance method. Any object created from such a class includes
a <span class="code">stroke()</span> method. We say that an <b>object</b> implements an
<span class="code">interface</span> if it belongs to a class that implements the interface. For
example, any object of type <span class="classname">Line</span> implements the <span class="classname">Strokeable</span>
interface.</p>


<p>While a class can <b>extend</b> only one other class, it can
<b>implement</b> any number of interfaces. In fact, a class can both extend
one other class and implement one or more interfaces.  So, we can have things
like</p>


<pre>class FilledCircle extends Circle 
                        implements Strokeable, Fillable {
   . . .
}</pre>


<p>The point of all this is that, although interfaces are not classes, they are
something very similar. An interface is very much like an abstract class, that
is, a class that can never be used for constructing objects, but can be used as
a basis for making subclasses. The subroutines in an interface are abstract
methods, which must be implemented in any concrete class that implements the
interface.  You can compare the <span class="classname">Strokeable</span>
interface with the abstract class</p>


<pre>public abstract class AbstractStrokeable {
   public abstract void stroke(GraphicsContext g);
}</pre>


<p>The main difference is that a class that extends <span class="classname">AbstractStrokeable</span>
cannot extend any other class, while a class that implements <span class="classname">Strokeable</span>
can also extend some class, as well as implement other interfaces.  Of course, an
abstract class can contain non-abstract methods as well as abstract methods.
An interface is like a "pure" abstract class, which contains only abstract methods.</p>


<p>Note that the methods declared in an interface must be <span class="code">public</span> and <span class="code">abstract</span>.  In fact,
since that is the only option, it is not necessary to specify either of these modifiers in
the declaration.</p>


<p>In addition to method declarations, an interface can also include variable
declarations.  The variables must be <span class="code">"public static final"</span>
and effectively become public static final variables in every class that implements
the interface.  In fact, since the variables can only be public and static and final,
specifying the modifiers is optional.  For example,</p>


<pre>public interface ConversionFactors {
    int INCHES_PER_FOOT = 12;
    int FEET_PER_YARD = 3;
    int YARDS_PER_MILE = 1760;
}</pre>


<p>This is a convenient way to define named constants that can be
used in several classes.  A class that implements <span class="classname">ConversionFactors</span>
can use the constants defined in the interface as if they were defined in the
class.</p>


<p>Note in particular that any variable that is defined in an interface is
a constant.  It's not really a variable at all.  An interface <b>cannot</b> add
instance variables to the classes that implement it.</p>


<p>An interface can extend one or more other interfaces.  For example, if 
<span class="classname">Strokeable</span> is the interface given above and <span class="classname">Fillable</span>
is an interface that defines a method <span class="code">fill(g)</span>, then we could define</p>


<pre>public interface Drawable extends Strokeable, Fillable {
    // (more methods/constants could be defined here)
}</pre>


<p>A concrete class that implements <span class="classname">Drawable</span> must then
provide implementations for the <span class="code">stroke()</span> method from 
<span class="classname">Strokeable</span> and the <span class="code">draw()</span> method from
<span class="classname">Fillable</span>, as well as for any abstract methods specified
directly in the <span class="classname">Drawable</span> interface.</p>


<p>An <span class="code">interface</span> is usually defined in its own .java file, whose
name must match the name of the <span class="code">interface</span>.  For example, 
<span class="classname">Strokeable</span> would be defined in a file named
<span class="code">Strokeable.java</span>.  Just like a <span class="code">class</span>, an
<span class="code">interface</span> can be in a package and can <span class="code">import</span>
things from other packages.</p>




<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="OOP.7.1a">5.7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Default Methods</a>
</h3>


<p>Starting in Java 8, interfaces can contain <span class="classname">default methods</span>.
Unlike the usual abstract methods in interfaces, a default method has an implementation.  When a class
implements the interface, it does not have to provide an implementation for the
default method&mdash;although it can do so if it wants to provide a different implementation.
Essentially, default methods are inherited from interfaces in much the same way that
ordinary methods are inherited from classes.  This moves Java partway towards supporting
multiple inheritance.  It's not true multiple inheritance, however, since interfaces
still cannot define instance variables.  Default methods can call abstract methods that
are defined in the same interface, but they cannot refer to any instance variables.</p>


<p>Note that a functional interface can include default methods in addition to
the single abstract method that it specified.</p>


<p>A default method in an interface must be marked with the modifier <span class="code">default</span>.
It can optionally be marked <span class="code">public</span> but, as for everything else in interfaces,
default methods are automatically public and the <span class="code">public</span> modifier can be omitted.
Here is an example:</p>


<pre>public interface Readable { // represents a source of input

    public char readChar();  // read the next character from the input

    default public String readLine() { // read up to the next line feed
        StringBuilder line = new StringBuilder();
        char ch = readChar();
        while (ch != '\n') {
            line.append(ch);
            ch = readChar();
        }
        return line.toString();
    }

}</pre>


<p>A concrete class that implements this interface must provide an implementation for
<span class="code">readChar()</span>.  It will inherit a definition for <span class="code">readLine()</span> from the interface,
but can provide a new definition if necessary.  When a class includes an implementation
for a <span class="code">default</span> method, the implementation given in the class overrides the
default method from the <span class="code">interface</span>.</p>


<p>Note that the default
<span class="code">readLine()</span> calls the abstract method <span class="code">readChar()</span>,
whose definition will only be provided in an implementing class.  The reference
to <span class="code">readChar()</span> in the definition is polymorphic.
The default implementation of <span class="code">readLine()</span> is one that would make 
sense in almost any class that implements <span class="classname">Readable</span>.  Here's
a rather silly example of a class that implements <span class="classname">Readable</span>,
including a <span class="code">main()</span> routine that tests the class. Can you figure out
what it does?</p>



<pre>public class Stars implements Readable {

    public char readChar() {
        if (Math.random() &gt; 0.02)
           return '*';
        else
           return '\n';
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Stars stars = new Stars();
        for (int i = 0 ; i &lt; 10; i++ ) {
            String line = stars.readLine();  // Calls the default method!
            System.out.println( line );
        }
    }
      
}</pre>


<p>Default methods provide Java with a capability similar to something called
a "mixin" in other programming languages, namely the ability to mix functionality from
another source into a class. Since a class can implement several interfaces,
it is possible to mix in functionality from several different sources.</p>

<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="OOP.7.2">5.7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Interfaces as Types</a>
</h3>


<p>As with abstract classes, even though you can't construct an
object from an interface, you can declare a variable whose type is given by the
interface. For example, if <span class="classname">Strokeable</span> is the interface given above, and if
<span class="classname">Line</span> and <span class="classname">Circle</span> are classes that implement
<span class="classname">Strokeable</span>, as above, then you could say:</p>


<pre>Strokeable figure;  // Declare a variable of type Strokeable.  It
                    //    can refer to any object that implements the
                    //    Strokeable interface.
                  
figure = new Line();  // figure now refers to an object of class Line
figure.stroke(g);   // calls stroke() method from class Line

figure = new Circle();   // Now, figure refers to an object
                               //   of class Circle.
figure.stroke(g);   // calls stroke() method from class Circle</pre>


<p>A variable of type <span class="classname">Strokeable</span> can refer to any object of any class
that implements the <span class="classname">Strokeable</span> interface. A statement like
<span class="code">figure.stroke(g)</span>, above, is legal because <span class="code">figure</span> is of type
<span class="classname">Strokeable</span>, and <b>any</b> 
<span class="classname">Strokeable</span> object has a <span class="code">stroke()</span>
method.  So, whatever object <span class="code">figure</span> refers to, that object must
have a <span class="code">stroke()</span> method.</p>


<p>Note that a <span class="newword">type</span> is something that can be used
to declare variables. A type can also be used to specify the type of a
parameter in a subroutine, or the return type of a function. In Java, a type
can be either a class, an interface, or one of the eight built-in primitive
types. These are the only possibilities (given a few special cases, such
as an <span class="code">enum</span>, which is considered to be a special kind of class).
Of these, however, only classes can be used to construct new objects.</p>


<p>An interface can also be the base type of an array.  For example, we can
use an array type <span class="atype">Strokeable[]</span> to declare
variables and create arrays.  The elements
of the array can refer to any objects that implement the <span class="classname">Strokeable</span>
interface:</p>


<pre>Strokeable[] listOfFigures;
listOfFigures = new Strokeable[10];
listOfFigures[0] = new Line();
listOfFigures[1] = new Circle();
listOfFigures[2] = new Line();
  .
  .
  .</pre>
  
  
<p>Every element of the array will then have a <span class="code">stroke()</span> method, so that
  we can say things like <span class="code">listOfFigures[i].stroke(g)</span>.</p>
