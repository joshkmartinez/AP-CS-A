<p>
<a href="../c4/ex8-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;4.8</a> asked you to write
a program that administers a 10-question addition quiz.  Rewrite that program
so that it uses the following class to represent addition questions:</p>

<pre>public class AdditionQuestion {

    private int a, b;  // The numbers in the problem.

    public AdditionQuestion() { // constructor
        a = (int)(Math.random() * 50 + 1);
        b = (int)(Math.random() * 50);
    }

    public String getQuestion() {
        return "What is " + a + " + " + b + " ?";
    }

    public int getCorrectAnswer() {
        return a + b;
    }

}</pre>

<hr>
<p>The original program used two array of type <span class="ptype">int[]</span>
to represent the addition questions.  One array held the first number from each of
the ten problems, while the other array held the second number.  This representation is
an example of <span class="newword">parallel arrays</span>: The data for a single question is split
between two arrays.  (The arrays are called "parallel" because to see all the data for
a problem next to each other, you would have to lay the arrays down next to each other,
like parallel lines, so the i-th element in one array lies next to the i-th element in
the other array.)</p>

<p>The new version of the program can use an array of ten objects of type
<span class="classname">AdditionQuestion</span> to represent the quiz.  The data that we need for
any one question can now be found in the same place&mdash;the object that represents that
question.  This makes for a neater solution than using parallel arrays.</p>

<p>Some of the functionality
that we need to create, administer, and grade the quiz has been incorporated into
the <span class="classname">AdditionQuestion</span> class.  For example, the constructor in that
class already selects random numbers to be used in the problem, so creating a problem is
just a matter of calling the constructor, and there is no need to use random numbers when
making a problem in the <span class="code">createQuiz()</span> method.  Also, to get the question
and correct answer for a problem, we can just call <span class="code">questions[i].getQuestion()</span>
and <span class="code">questions[i].getCorrectAnswer()</span>.  In fact, we can't get the question
any other way, since the two instance variables in
an <span class="classname">ArithmeticQuestion</span> are <span class="code">private</span>.
One downside of this is that I couln't format the output from <span class="code">gradeQuis()</span>
as neatly as in the first version.</p>

<p>All-in-all, it is fairly straightforward to translate the
old version of the program into the new version. You can read my solution below.</p>

<p>By the way, I considered adding the user's answer to the <span class="classname">AdditionQuestion</span>
class, along with the correct answer, but the user's answer doesn't seem to me to be logically
part of a question.  So I think it makes more sense to keep it out of the object that
represents the question.</p>

<p>Remember that this program depends on the <span class="classname">AdditionQuestion</span> class that is given in the
statement of the problem.</p>
