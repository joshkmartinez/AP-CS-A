<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 5.3</h2>
<hr class="break">
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 5.3:</h3>
<p>This problem uses the
<span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> class from <a href="../c5/ex1-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;5.1</a>
and the <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> class from <a href="../c5/ex2-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;5.2</a>.</p>


<p>The program in <a href="../c4/ex4-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;4.4</a> performs
the experiment of counting how many times a pair of dice is rolled before a
given total comes up. It repeats this experiment 10000 times and then reports
the average number of rolls. It does this whole process for each possible total
(2, 3, ..., 12).</p>


<p>Redo that exercise. But instead of just reporting the average number of
rolls, you should also report the standard deviation and the maximum number of
rolls. Use a <span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> object to represent the dice. Use a
<span class="classname">StatCalc</span> object to compute the statistics. (You'll need a new
<span class="classname">StatCalc</span> object for each possible total, 2, 3, ..., 12. You can use a
new pair of dice if you want, but it's not required.)</p>

<hr>

<p>The program from <a href="../c4/ex4-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;4.4</a> defines
a function, <span class="code">rollFor(N)</span>, that performs the basic experiment once. It
rolls the dice until the total on the dice is <span class="code">N</span>, and it returns the
number of rolls. Using a <span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> object, <span class="code">dice</span>, the body of
this subroutine becomes</p>


<pre>int rollCt = 0;  // Number of rolls made.
do {
   dice.roll();
   rollCt++;
} while ( dice.getTotal() != N );
return rollCt;</pre>


<p>This is significantly simpler than the original version. But where does the
dice object come from? One possibility is to create a new <span class="classname">PairOfDice</span>
object at the beginning of the function. This will work, but then a new object
is created each time the function is called. In the program we are writing, the
function is called 110,000 times. It seems a waste to manufacture 110,000 pairs
of dice when one would do! To avoid this, I create the dice as a static member
variable:</p>


<pre>private static PairOfDice dice = new PairOfDice();</pre>


<p>The variable must be <span class="code">static</span> since it is used in the <span class="code">static</span>
function, <span class="code">rollFor</span>. Since <span class="code">dice</span> is a static member variable, it
is created and initialized when the class is first loaded and it exists as long
as the program is running. The <span class="code">rollFor()</span> method always uses this one
pair of dice. (Some people might prefer to create the dice as a local variable
in the <span class="code">main()</span> routine. The dice could be passed as a parameter to the
<span class="code">rollFor()</span> method. Then, <span class="code">rollFor(N,dice)</span> would mean "roll for
a total of <span class="code">N</span> using this pair of dice." But in my opinion, the dice are not
logically a part of the interface of this subroutine, and I prefer to use the
member variable.)</p>


<p>The original program also had a method called <span class="code">getAverageRollCount()</span>
to find the average number of rolls, when the basic experiment is repeated
10000 times. We could rename this to <span class="code">getRollCountStats</span> and use it to
compute all the statistics, not just the average. The actual computation is to
be done by a <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> object. Let <span class="code">stats</span> be a variable that
refers to that object. The results of each experiment will be fed into this
object, something like this:</p>


<pre>for ( int i = 0;  i &lt; 10000;  i++ ) {
      // Assume "total" is the number we are rolling for.
    rollCountThisExperiment = rollFor( total );  // Do one experiment.
    stats.enter( rollCountThisExperiment );      // Enter the data.
}</pre>


<p>At the end of this process, <span class="code">stats</span> is ready to report the
statistics. All you have to do is call its functions, such as
<span class="code">stats.getMean()</span>.</p>


<p>In my program, I use the named constant <span class="code">NUMBER_OF_EXPERIMENTS</span>
instead of the literal number, 10000. I abbreviate the for loop to</p>


<pre>for ( int i = 0;  i &lt; NUMBER_OF_EXPERIMENTS;  i++ ) 
    stats.enter( rollFor(total) );</pre>


<p>and, since it has become so short, I deleted the subroutine and moved the
<span class="code">for</span> loop into the <span class="code">main()</span> routine. The <span class="code">main()</span> routine
prints the output in neat columns, using formatted output. For example,
"<span class="code">System.out.printf("%6d",total);</span>" prints the value of <span class="code">total</span> in a column
of width 6. (The hardest part was figuring out how wide to make the columns!).
After printing out some headings for the columns, the <span class="code">main()</span> routine
says</p>


<pre>for ( int total = 2;  total &lt;= 12;  total++ ) {
   StatCalc stats;  // An object that will compute the statistics.
   stats = new StatCalc();
   for ( int i = 0; i &lt; NUMBER_OF_EXPERIMENTS; i++ ) {
         // Do the experiment of counting the number of rolls
         // required to roll the desired total, and enter the
         // number of rolls into stats' dataset.
      stats.enter( rollFor(total) );
   }
   System.out.printf("%6d", total);
   System.out.printf("%18.3f", stats.getMean());
   System.out.printf("%19.3f", stats.getStandardDeviation());
   System.out.printf("%14.3f", stats.getMax());
   System.out.println();
}</pre>



<p>The body of the <span class="code">for</span> loop processes one of the possible totals on a
pair of dice, and it produces one line of output with the statistics for that
total. A new <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> object is created for each execution of the
<span class="code">for</span> loop. This is necessary because we want separate statistics for
each total. A single <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> object would just accumulate all the
data for all the possible values of total into a single dataset. It might be worth
noting that the five output statements in this method could be written as
a single statement:</p>


<pre>System.out.printf( "%6d%18.3f%19.3f%14.3f%n", total, stats.getMean(), 
        stats.getStandardDeveialtion(), stats.getMax() );</pre>


<hr class="break">


<p>By the way, you might wonder what would happen if I had not eliminated the
<span class="code">getRollCountStats()</span> subroutine? In that case, the statistics data is
generated in the subroutine and is used in the <span class="code">main()</span> routine. So, the
same <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> object has to be used in both routines. There are
several ways to handle this. The variable, <span class="code">stats</span>, could be a static
member variable. Then it could simply be used in both routines. Alternatively,
the <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> object could be passed as a parameter to the subroutine.
Or, as a final and best alternative, the object could be created in the subroutine and
sent back to the <span class="code">main()</span> routine as a return value. Let's look at this
last possibility. The subroutine would be:</p>


<pre>static StatCalc getRollCountStats( int total ) {
    StatCalc calc;         // An object to compute the statistics.
    calc = new StatCalc();
    for ( int i = 0; i &lt; NUMBER_OF_EXPERIMENTS; i++ )
        calc.enter( rollFor(total) );
    return calc;  // Send back the object, with the statistics.
}</pre>


<p>In the main program, this would be used as follows:</p>


<pre>for ( int total = 2; total &lt;= 12; total++ ) {
   StatCalc stats;  // The stats for this total
   stats = getRollCountStats( total ); // Get stats from subroutine.
   System.out.printf("%6d", total);
   System.out.printf("%18.3f", stats.getMean());
   System.out.printf("%19.3f", stats.getStandardDeviation());
   System.out.printf("%14.3f", stats.getMax());
   System.out.println();
}</pre>


<p>Note in particular that not every object variable needs to be initialized
with a new object. In the case of the variable <span class="code">calc</span> in the
<span class="code">main()</span> routine, an object is computed elsewhere. The variable,
<span class="code">calc</span>, is set to refer to that existing object.</p>
