<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> questions on Chapter 5 of
           <a href="../index.html"><i>Introduction to Programming Using Java</i></a>.
           You should be able to answer these questions after studying that chapter.
           Sample answers to these questions can be found <a href="quiz_answers.html">here</a>.</p>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;1:</p>
<p>Object-oriented programming
uses <i>classes</i> and <i>objects</i>. What are classes and what are objects?
What is the relationship between classes and objects?</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;2:</p>
<p>Explain carefully what
<i>null</i> means in Java, and why this special value is necessary.</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;3:</p>
<p>What is a
<i>constructor?</i> What is the purpose of a constructor in a class?</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;4:</p>
<p>Suppose that
<span class="code">Kumquat</span> is the name of a class and that <span class="code">fruit</span> is a variable
of type <span class="code">Kumquat.</span> What is the meaning of the statement "<span class="code">fruit = new
Kumquat();</span>"? That is, what does the computer do when it executes this
statement? (Try to give a complete answer. The computer does several
things.)</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;5:</p>
<p>What is meant by the terms
<i>instance variable</i> and <i>instance method</i>?</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;6:</p>
<p>Explain what is meant by the
terms <i>subclass</i> and <i>superclass.</i>
</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;7:</p>
<p>Modify the following class so that the two instance variables are <span class="code">private</span>
and there is a getter method and a setter method for each instance variable:</p>

<pre>public class Player {
   String name;
   int score;
}</pre>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;8:</p>
<p>Explain why the class <span class="classname">Player</span> that is defined in the previous
question has an instance method named <span class="code">toString()</span>, even though no definition
of this method appears in the definition of the class.</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;9:</p>
<p>Explain the term
<i>polymorphism.</i>
</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;10:</p>
<p>Java uses "garbage

collection. What is the alternative to garbage collection?</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;11:</p>
<p>What is an <i>abstract class</i>, and how can you recognize an abstract class in Java?</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;12:</p>
<p>What is <span class="code">this</span>?</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;13:</p>
<p>For this problem, you should
write a very simple but complete class. The class represents a counter that
counts 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,&nbsp;.... The name of the class should be <span class="code">Counter</span>. It
has one <span class="code">private</span> instance variable representing the value of the
counter. It has two instance methods: <span class="code">increment()</span> adds one to the
counter value, and <span class="code">getValue()</span> returns the current counter value. Write
a complete definition for the class, <span class="code">Counter</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;14:</p>
<p>This problem uses the
<span class="code">Counter</span> class from the previous question. The following program segment is meant
to simulate tossing a coin 100 times. It should use two <span class="code">Counter</span>
objects, <span class="code">headCount</span> and <span class="code">tailCount</span>, to count the number of
heads and the number of tails. Fill in the blanks so that it will do so:</p>


<pre>Counter headCount, tailCount;
tailCount = new Counter();
headCount = new Counter();
for ( int flip = 0;  flip &lt; 100;  flip++ ) {
   if (Math.random() &lt; 0.5)    // There's a 50/50 chance that this is true.
   
       ______________________ ;   // Count a "head".
       
   else
   
       ______________________ ;   // Count a "tail".
}

System.out.println("There were " + ___________________ + " heads.");

System.out.println("There were " + ___________________ + " tails.");</pre>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;15:</p>
<p>Explain why it can <b>never</b> make sense to test "<span class="code">if (obj.equals(null))</span>".</p>
