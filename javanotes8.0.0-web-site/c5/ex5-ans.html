<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 5.5:</h3>
<p>Write a program that lets
the user play Blackjack. The game will be a simplified version of Blackjack as
it is played in a casino. The computer will act as the dealer. As in the
previous exercise, your program will need the classes defined in 
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter5/Card.java">Card.java</a></span>, <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter5/Deck.java">Deck.java</a></span>, 
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter5/Hand.java">Hand.java</a></span>, and <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter5/BlackjackHand.java">BlackjackHand.java</a></span>.
(This is the longest and
most complex program that has come up so far in the exercises.)</p>


<p>You should first write a subroutine in which the user plays one game. The
subroutine should return a <span class="ptype">boolean</span> value to indicate whether the user
wins the game or not. Return <span class="code">true</span> if the user wins, <span class="code">false</span> if
the dealer wins. The program needs an object of class <span class="classname">Deck</span> and two
objects of type <span class="classname">BlackjackHand</span>, one for the dealer and one for the
user. The general object in Blackjack is to get a hand of cards whose value is
as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The game goes like this.</p>


<ul>

<li>First, two cards are dealt into each player's hand. If the dealer's hand has
a value of 21 at this point, then the dealer wins. Otherwise, if the user has
21, then the user wins. (This is called a "Blackjack".) Note that the dealer
wins on a tie, so if both players have Blackjack, then the dealer wins.</li>


<li>Now, if the game has not ended, the user gets a chance to add some cards to
her hand. In this phase, the user sees her own cards and sees
<b>one</b> of the dealer's two cards. (In a casino, the dealer deals
himself one card face up and one card face down. All the user's cards are dealt
face up.) The user makes a decision whether to "Hit", which means to add
another card to her hand, or to "Stand", which means to stop taking cards.</li>


<li>If the user Hits, there is a possibility that the user will go over 21. In
that case, the game is over and the user loses. If not, then the process
continues. The user gets to decide again whether to Hit or Stand.</li>


<li>If the user Stands, the game will end, but first the dealer gets a chance to
draw cards. The dealer only follows rules, without any choice. The rule is that
as long as the value of the dealer's hand is less than or equal to 16, the
dealer Hits (that is, takes another card). The user should see all the dealer's
cards at this point. Now, the winner can be determined: If the dealer has gone
over 21, the user wins. Otherwise, if the dealer's total is greater than or
equal to the user's total, then the dealer wins. Otherwise, the user wins.</li>

</ul>



<p>Two notes on programming: At any point in the subroutine, as soon as you
know who the winner is, you can say "<span class="code">return true</span>;" or "<span class="code">return
false</span>;" to end the subroutine and return to the main program. To avoid
having an overabundance of variables in your subroutine, remember that a
function call such as <span class="code">userHand.getBlackjackValue()</span> can be used
anywhere that a number could be used, including in an output statement or in
the condition of an <span class="code">if</span> statement.</p>


<p>Write a main program that lets the user play several games of Blackjack. To
make things interesting, give the user 100 dollars, and let the user make bets
on the game. If the user loses, subtract the bet from the user's money. If the
user wins, add an amount equal to the bet to the user's money. End the program
when the user wants to quit or when she runs out of money.</p>


<hr>
<div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr>

<p>Let's start by designing the main program. We want to give the user $100 for
betting on the games. Then, the user plays Blackjack games until the user runs
out of money or until the user wants to quit. We could ask the user after each
game whether she wants to continue. But instead of this, I just tell the user
to enter a bet amount of 0 if she wants to quit. We need variables to represent
the amount of money that the user has and the amount that the user bets on a
given game. Let <span class="code">money</span> and <span class="code">bet</span> be variables of type
<span class="ptype">int</span> to represent these quantities. Then, we can write an algorithm for
the main program:</p>


<pre>Let money = 100
while (true):
    Input the user's bet
    if the bet is 0:
        Break out of the loop
    User plays a game of Blackjack
    if the user won the game
        Pay off the user's bet (money = money + bet)
    else
        Collect the user's bet (money = money - bet)
    If the user is out of money:
        Break out of the loop.</pre>


<p>Since the Blackjack game will take place in a subroutine, we need some way
for the <span class="code">main()</span> routine to find out whether the user won. The exercise
says that the subroutine should be a function that returns a boolean value with
this information. We should record the return value and test it to see whether
the user won. The other point that needs some refinement is inputting the
user's bet. We better make sure that the user's bet is a reasonable amount,
that is, something between 0 and the amount of money the user has. So, the
algorithm can be refined as:</p>


<pre>Let money = 100
while (true):
    do {
        Ask the user to enter a bet
        Let bet = the user's response
    } while bet is &lt; 0 or &gt; money
    if  bet is 0:
        Break out of the loop
    Let userWins = playBlackjack()
    if userWins:
        Pay off the user's bet (money = money + bet)
    else
        Collect the user's bet (money = money - bet)
    If money == 0:
        Break out of the loop.</pre>


<p>This algorithm can be translated into the <span class="code">main()</span> routine in the
program given below.</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>Of course, the major part of the problem is to write the
<span class="code">playBlackjack()</span> routine. Fortunately, the exercise gives what amounts
to a fairly detailed outline of the algorithm. Things are a little complicated
because the game can end at various points along the way. When this happens,
the subroutine ends immediately, and any remaining steps in the algorithm are
skipped. In outline, the game goes like this:</p>


<pre>Create and shuffle a deck of cards
Create two BlackjackHands, userHand and dealerHand
Deal two cards into each hand
Check if dealer has blackjack (if so, game ends)
Check if user has blackjack (if so, game ends)
User draws cards (if user goes over 21, game ends)
Dealer draws cards (if dealer goes over 21, games ends)
Check for winner</pre>


<p>The last three steps need to be expanded, again using the information stated
in the exercise. The user can draw several cards, so we need a loop. The loop
ends when the user wants to "stand". In the loop, if the value of
<span class="code">userHand</span> goes over 21, then the whole subroutine ends. The dealer
simply draws cards in a loop as long as the value of <span class="code">dealerHand</span> is 16
or less. Again, if the value goes over 21, the whole subroutine ends. In the
last step, we determine the winner by comparing the values of the two hands.
With these refinements, the algorithm becomes</p>


<pre>Create and shuffle a deck of cards
Create two BlackjackHands, userHand and dealerHand

Deal two cards into each hand
if dealer has blackjack
    User loses and the game ends now
If user has blackjack
    User wins and the game ends now

Repeat:
    Ask whether user wants to hit or stand
    if user stands:
        break out of loop
    if user hits:
        Give user a card
        if userHand.getBlackjackValue() &gt; 21:
            User loses and the game ends now

while  dealerHand.getBlackjackValue() &lt;= 16 :
    Give dealer a card
    if dealerHand.getBlackjackValue() &gt; 21:
        User wins and game ends now

if dealerHand.getBlackjackValue() &gt;= userHand.getBlackjackValue()
    User loses
else
    User wins</pre>


<p>This is ready to be translated into Java. One point of coding is the
question of how to deal a card to the user or to the dealer. If <span class="code">deck</span>
refers to the object of type <span class="classname">Deck</span>, then the function call
<span class="code">deck.dealCard()</span> returns the card we want. We can add the card to a
hand with the <span class="code">addCard()</span> instance method from the <span class="classname">Hand</span> class.
We can do this in one step, if we want. For example, to deal two cards into
each hand, we just have to say</p>


<pre>dealerHand.addCard( deck.dealCard() );
dealerHand.addCard( deck.dealCard() );
userHand.addCard( deck.dealCard() );
userHand.addCard( deck.dealCard() );</pre>


<p>Of course, a lot of output statements have to be added to the algorithm to
keep the user informed about what is going on. For example, I expanded the step
where it says "Ask whether user wants to hit or stand" to</p>


<pre>Display all the cards in the user's hand
Display the user's total
Display the dealers face-up card, i.e. dealerHand.getCard(0)
Ask if user wants to hit or stand
Get user's response, and make sure it's legal</pre>


<p>The last step listed here expands to a loop that ends when the user inputs a
valid response, 'H' or 'S'. The first step uses a <span class="code">for</span> loop
to display the cards in the user's hand:</p>


<pre>for ( int i = 0;  i &lt; userHand.getCardCount();  i++ )
     System.out.println("   " + userHand.getCard(i));</pre>


<p>The function call
<span class="code">userHand.getCardCount()</span> gives the number of cards in the hand. The
cards are numbered from 0 to <span class="code">userHand.getCardCount()&nbsp;-&nbsp;1</span>, and
<span class="code">userHand.getCard(i)</span> is the card in the <span class="code">i</span>-position. Of course,
to produce code like this, you have to make sure that you are familiar with the
methods in the classes that you are using.</p>


<p>Although there are many other details to get right, it's mostly routine from
here on. I encourage you to read the entire program below and make sure that
you understand it.</p>
