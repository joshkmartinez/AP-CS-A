<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 5.4:</h3>
<p>The <span class="classname">BlackjackHand</span>
class from <a href="../c5/s5.html#OOP.5.1">Subsection&nbsp;5.5.1</a> is an extension of the
<span class="classname">Hand</span> class from <a href="../c5/s4.html">Section&nbsp;5.4</a>. The instance
methods in the <span class="classname">Hand</span> class are discussed in that section. In addition to
those methods, <span class="classname">BlackjackHand</span> includes an instance method,
<span class="code">getBlackjackValue()</span>, which returns the value of the hand for the game
of Blackjack. For this exercise, you will also need the <span class="classname">Deck</span> and
<span class="classname">Card</span> classes from <a href="../c5/s4.html">Section&nbsp;5.4</a>.</p>


<p>A Blackjack hand typically contains from two to six cards. Write a program
to test the <span class="classname">BlackjackHand</span> class. You should create a
<span class="classname">BlackjackHand</span> object and a <span class="classname">Deck</span> object. Pick a random number
between 2 and 6. Deal that many cards from the deck and add them to the hand.
Print out all the cards in the hand, and then print out the value computed for
the hand by <span class="code">getBlackjackValue()</span>. Repeat this as long as the user wants
to continue.</p>


<p>In addition to <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter5/textio/TextIO.java">TextIO.java</a></span>, your program will depend on 
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter5/Card.java">Card.java</a></span>, <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter5/Deck.java">Deck.java</a></span>, 
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter5/Hand.java">Hand.java</a></span>, and <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter5/BlackjackHand.java">BlackjackHand.java</a></span>.</p>

<p>This problem is mostly a warm-up for the <a href="../c5/ex5-ans.html">next
one</a>. It uses objects of three different types, <span class="classname">Card</span>,
<span class="classname">Deck</span>, and <span class="classname">BlackjackHand</span>. 
The <span class="classname">Hand</span> class is used
indirectly, as the superclass of <span class="classname">BlackjackHand</span>. To use these objects,
you need to know what methods are available in each class, so you should review
the information that you have about the classes before beginning the
program.</p>


<p>An algorithm for the program is</p>


<pre>Create a deck
repeat while user wants to continue:
    Shuffle the deck
    Create a new BlackjackHand
    Decide the number of cards in the hand
    Deal cards from the deck into the hand, and print them out
    Display the value of the hand</pre>


<p>Some variation is possible. You could use just one <span class="classname">BlackjackHand</span>
object, and remove all the cards from it between hands. The <span class="classname">Hand</span> class
includes an instance method, <span class="code">clear()</span>, that could be used for this
purpose. Similarly, you could create a new <span class="classname">Deck</span> object each time
through the loop. Or, you might want to use one deck and shuffle it only when
the number of cards in the deck gets too small. You could say:</p>


<pre>if (deck.cardsLeft() &lt; 6)  
      deck.shuffle();</pre>


<p>Since we always want to do at least one hand, we can use a
<span class="code">do..while</span> statement for the loop. Putting in some variable names, we
can refine the algorithm to</p>


<pre>deck  =  new Deck();
do:
    deck.shuffle();
    hand  =  new BlackjackHand();
    cardsInHand = a random number between 2 and 6
    Deal cards from deck into hand, and print them out.
    Display hand.getBlackjackValue()
    Ask if user wants to go again
while user wants to go again</pre>


<p>The number of cards in the hand is supposed to be a random number between 2
and 6. There are five possible values. The expression
"<span class="code">(int)(Math.random()*5)</span>" has one of the 5 possible values 0, 1, 2, 3,
or 4. Adding 2 to the result gives one of the values 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. So, the
number of cards can be computed as "<span class="code">2&nbsp;+&nbsp;(int)(Math.random()*5)</span>".</p>


<p>Once we know the number of cards, we can use a <span class="code">for</span> loop to deal
cards into the hand, one at a time. The function call <span class="code">deck.dealCard()</span>
gets a card from the deck. Once we have a card, we can add it to the hand with
the subroutine call <span class="code">hand.addCard(card)</span>. This allows us to refine the
algorithm to</p>


<pre>deck  =  new Deck();
do:
    deck.shuffle();
    hand  =  new BlackjackHand();
    cardsInHand = 2 + (int)(Math.random()*5)
    for i = 0 to cardsInHand:
        card  =  deck.dealCard()
        hand.addCard(card)
        Display the card
    Display hand.getBlackjackValue()
    Ask if user wants to go again
while user wants to go again</pre>


<p>Alternatively, dealing the cards and displaying them could be done in
separate <span class="code">for</span> loops.</p>


<p>This algorithm can be translated pretty directly into the <span class="code">main()</span>
routine of the program, which is shown below.</p>
