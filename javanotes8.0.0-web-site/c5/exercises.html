<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 5.1:</h3>
<p>In all versions of the
<span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> class in <a href="../c5/s2.html">Section&nbsp;5.2</a>, the instance
variables <span class="code">die1</span> and <span class="code">die2</span> are declared to be <span class="code">public</span>.
They really should be <span class="code">private</span>, so that they would be protected from being changed
from outside the class. Write another version of the <span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> class
in which the instance variables <span class="code">die1</span> and <span class="code">die2</span> are
<span class="code">private</span>. Your class will need "getter" methods that can be used to find out the
values of <span class="code">die1</span> and <span class="code">die2</span>. (The idea is to protect their values
from being changed from outside the class, but still to allow the values to be
read.) Include other improvements in the class, including at least a <span class="code">toString()</span> method. 
Test your class with a short program that counts how many times a pair of dice is
rolled, before the total of the two dice is equal to two.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 5.2:</h3>
<p>A common programming task
is computing statistics of a set of numbers. (A statistic is a number that
summarizes some property of a set of data.) Common statistics include the mean
(also known as the average) and the standard deviation (which tells how spread
out the data are from the mean). I have written a little class called
<span class="classname">StatCalc</span> that can be used to compute these statistics, as well as the
sum of the items in the dataset and the number of items in the dataset. You can
read the source code for this class in the file <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter5/StatCalc.java">StatCalc.java</a></span>.
If <span class="code">calc</span> is a variable of
type <span class="classname">StatCalc</span>, then the following instance methods are available:</p>


<ul>

<li>
<span class="code">calc.enter(item)&nbsp;</span> where
<span class="code">item</span> is a number, adds the item to the dataset.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">calc.getCount()&nbsp;</span> is a function
that returns the number of items that have been added to the dataset.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">calc.getSum()&nbsp;</span> is a function
that returns the sum of all the items that have been added to the dataset.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">calc.getMean()&nbsp;</span> is a function
that returns the average of all the items.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">calc.getStandardDeviation()&nbsp;</span> is
a function that returns the standard deviation of the items.</li>

</ul>


<p>Typically, all the data are added one after the other by calling the
<span class="code">enter()</span> method over and over, as the data become available. After all
the data have been entered, any of the other methods can be called to get
statistical information about the data. The methods <span class="code">getMean()</span> and
<span class="code">getStandardDeviation()</span> should only be called if the number of items is
greater than zero.</p>


<p>Modify the current source code, <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter5/StatCalc.java">StatCalc.java</a></span>, to add instance
methods <span class="code">getMax()</span> and <span class="code">getMin()</span>. The <span class="code">getMax()</span> method
should return the largest of all the items that have been added to the dataset,
and <span class="code">getMin()</span> should return the smallest. You will need to add two new
instance variables to keep track of the largest and smallest items that have
been seen so far.</p>


<p>Test your new class by using it in a program to compute statistics for a set
of non-zero numbers entered by the user. Start by creating an object of type
<span class="classname">StatCalc</span>:</p>


<pre>StatCalc  calc;   // Object to be used to process the data.
calc = new StatCalc();</pre>


<p>Read numbers from the user and add them to the dataset. Use 0 as a sentinel
value (that is, stop reading numbers when the user enters 0). After all the
user's non-zero numbers have been entered, print out each of the six statistics
that are available from <span class="code">calc</span>.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 5.3:</h3>
<p>This problem uses the
<span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> class from <a href="../c5/ex1-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;5.1</a>
and the <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> class from <a href="../c5/ex2-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;5.2</a>.</p>


<p>The program in <a href="../c4/ex4-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;4.4</a> performs
the experiment of counting how many times a pair of dice is rolled before a
given total comes up. It repeats this experiment 10000 times and then reports
the average number of rolls. It does this whole process for each possible total
(2, 3, ..., 12).</p>


<p>Redo that exercise. But instead of just reporting the average number of
rolls, you should also report the standard deviation and the maximum number of
rolls. Use a <span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> object to represent the dice. Use a
<span class="classname">StatCalc</span> object to compute the statistics. (You'll need a new
<span class="classname">StatCalc</span> object for each possible total, 2, 3, ..., 12. You can use a
new pair of dice if you want, but it's not required.)</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 5.4:</h3>
<p>The <span class="classname">BlackjackHand</span>
class from <a href="../c5/s5.html#OOP.5.1">Subsection&nbsp;5.5.1</a> is an extension of the
<span class="classname">Hand</span> class from <a href="../c5/s4.html">Section&nbsp;5.4</a>. The instance
methods in the <span class="classname">Hand</span> class are discussed in that section. In addition to
those methods, <span class="classname">BlackjackHand</span> includes an instance method,
<span class="code">getBlackjackValue()</span>, which returns the value of the hand for the game
of Blackjack. For this exercise, you will also need the <span class="classname">Deck</span> and
<span class="classname">Card</span> classes from <a href="../c5/s4.html">Section&nbsp;5.4</a>.</p>


<p>A Blackjack hand typically contains from two to six cards. Write a program
to test the <span class="classname">BlackjackHand</span> class. You should create a
<span class="classname">BlackjackHand</span> object and a <span class="classname">Deck</span> object. Pick a random number
between 2 and 6. Deal that many cards from the deck and add them to the hand.
Print out all the cards in the hand, and then print out the value computed for
the hand by <span class="code">getBlackjackValue()</span>. Repeat this as long as the user wants
to continue.</p>


<p>In addition to <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter5/textio/TextIO.java">TextIO.java</a></span>, your program will depend on 
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter5/Card.java">Card.java</a></span>, <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter5/Deck.java">Deck.java</a></span>, 
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter5/Hand.java">Hand.java</a></span>, and <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter5/BlackjackHand.java">BlackjackHand.java</a></span>.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 5.5:</h3>
<p>Write a program that lets
the user play Blackjack. The game will be a simplified version of Blackjack as
it is played in a casino. The computer will act as the dealer. As in the
previous exercise, your program will need the classes defined in 
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter5/Card.java">Card.java</a></span>, <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter5/Deck.java">Deck.java</a></span>, 
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter5/Hand.java">Hand.java</a></span>, and <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter5/BlackjackHand.java">BlackjackHand.java</a></span>.
(This is the longest and
most complex program that has come up so far in the exercises.)</p>


<p>You should first write a subroutine in which the user plays one game. The
subroutine should return a <span class="ptype">boolean</span> value to indicate whether the user
wins the game or not. Return <span class="code">true</span> if the user wins, <span class="code">false</span> if
the dealer wins. The program needs an object of class <span class="classname">Deck</span> and two
objects of type <span class="classname">BlackjackHand</span>, one for the dealer and one for the
user. The general object in Blackjack is to get a hand of cards whose value is
as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The game goes like this.</p>


<ul>

<li>First, two cards are dealt into each player's hand. If the dealer's hand has
a value of 21 at this point, then the dealer wins. Otherwise, if the user has
21, then the user wins. (This is called a "Blackjack".) Note that the dealer
wins on a tie, so if both players have Blackjack, then the dealer wins.</li>


<li>Now, if the game has not ended, the user gets a chance to add some cards to
her hand. In this phase, the user sees her own cards and sees
<b>one</b> of the dealer's two cards. (In a casino, the dealer deals
himself one card face up and one card face down. All the user's cards are dealt
face up.) The user makes a decision whether to "Hit", which means to add
another card to her hand, or to "Stand", which means to stop taking cards.</li>


<li>If the user Hits, there is a possibility that the user will go over 21. In
that case, the game is over and the user loses. If not, then the process
continues. The user gets to decide again whether to Hit or Stand.</li>


<li>If the user Stands, the game will end, but first the dealer gets a chance to
draw cards. The dealer only follows rules, without any choice. The rule is that
as long as the value of the dealer's hand is less than or equal to 16, the
dealer Hits (that is, takes another card). The user should see all the dealer's
cards at this point. Now, the winner can be determined: If the dealer has gone
over 21, the user wins. Otherwise, if the dealer's total is greater than or
equal to the user's total, then the dealer wins. Otherwise, the user wins.</li>

</ul>



<p>Two notes on programming: At any point in the subroutine, as soon as you
know who the winner is, you can say "<span class="code">return true</span>;" or "<span class="code">return
false</span>;" to end the subroutine and return to the main program. To avoid
having an overabundance of variables in your subroutine, remember that a
function call such as <span class="code">userHand.getBlackjackValue()</span> can be used
anywhere that a number could be used, including in an output statement or in
the condition of an <span class="code">if</span> statement.</p>


<p>Write a main program that lets the user play several games of Blackjack. To
make things interesting, give the user 100 dollars, and let the user make bets
on the game. If the user loses, subtract the bet from the user's money. If the
user wins, add an amount equal to the bet to the user's money. End the program
when the user wants to quit or when she runs out of money.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 5.6:</h3>
<p>
<a href="../c4/ex8-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;4.8</a> asked you to write
a program that administers a 10-question addition quiz.  Rewrite that program
so that it uses the following class to represent addition questions:</p>

<pre>public class AdditionQuestion {

    private int a, b;  // The numbers in the problem.

    public AdditionQuestion() { // constructor
        a = (int)(Math.random() * 50 + 1);
        b = (int)(Math.random() * 50);
    }

    public String getQuestion() {
        return "What is " + a + " + " + b + " ?";
    }

    public int getCorrectAnswer() {
        return a + b;
    }

}</pre>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 5.7:</h3>
<p>Rewrite the program from the <a href="../c5/ex6-ans.html">previous exercise</a>
so that it administers a quiz with several different kinds of questions.
In the previous exercise, you used
a class to represent addition questions.  For this exercise, you will use the following <span class="code">interface</span>,
or an equivalent abstract class, to represent the more general idea of a question that has
an integer as its answer:</p>

<pre>public interface IntQuestion {
    public String getQuestion();
    public int getCorrectAnswer();
}</pre>

<p>You can make the <span class="classname">AdditionQuestion</span> class implement the interface
simply by adding "<span class="code">implements IntQuestion</span>" to its definition.  Write a similar
class to represent subtraction questions.  When creating a subtraction problem, you should make
sure that the answer is not negative.</p>

<p>For the new program, use an array of type <span class="atype">IntQuestion[]</span> to hold the quiz
questions.  Include some addition questions and some subtraction questions in the quiz.
You can also add a couple non-math questions, including this one, created as an anonymous class:</p>

<pre>IntQuestion bigQuestion = new IntQuestion() {
    public String getQuestion() {
        return "What is the answer to the ultimate question " +
                 " of life, the universe, and everything?";
    }
    public int getCorrectAnswer() {
        return 42;
    }
};</pre>
