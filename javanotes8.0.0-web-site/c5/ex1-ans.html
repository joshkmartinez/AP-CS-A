<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 5.1:</h3>
<p>In all versions of the
<span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> class in <a href="../c5/s2.html">Section&nbsp;5.2</a>, the instance
variables <span class="code">die1</span> and <span class="code">die2</span> are declared to be <span class="code">public</span>.
They really should be <span class="code">private</span>, so that they would be protected from being changed
from outside the class. Write another version of the <span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> class
in which the instance variables <span class="code">die1</span> and <span class="code">die2</span> are
<span class="code">private</span>. Your class will need "getter" methods that can be used to find out the
values of <span class="code">die1</span> and <span class="code">die2</span>. (The idea is to protect their values
from being changed from outside the class, but still to allow the values to be
read.) Include other improvements in the class, including at least a <span class="code">toString()</span> method. 
Test your class with a short program that counts how many times a pair of dice is
rolled, before the total of the two dice is equal to two.</p>

<p>The versions of the <span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> class in Section 2 differ in how the
dice are initialized. I like the idea of initializing the dice to random
values, so I will work with the following version:</p>


<pre>public class PairOfDice {

    public int die1;   // Number showing on the first die.
    public int die2;   // Number showing on the second die.
    
    /**
     * Constructor creates a pair of dice and rolls them so that
     * they initially show some random value.
     */            
    public PairOfDice() {
        roll();  // Call the roll() method to roll the dice.
    }
    
    /**
     * Roll the dice by setting each die to be a random number between 1 and 6.
     */
    public void roll() {
        die1 = (int)(Math.random()*6) + 1;
        die2 = (int)(Math.random()*6) + 1;
    }
    
} // end class PairOfDice</pre>


<p>After a <span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> object has just been created, the number on each
die is definitely between 1 and 6, just like the number on a real die. Can we
be sure that this will always be true? Not if the instance variables
<span class="code">die1</span> and <span class="code">die2</span> are <span class="code">public</span>, since they can be changed
from outside the class. There is nothing to stop someone from changing them to
42 and -17 or anything else. It's not good enough to say that you're not
supposed to do that with dice. I want an absolute guarantee that my dice
objects can only have the values that real dice could have. By making
<span class="code">die1</span> and <span class="code">die2</span> <span class="code">private</span>, I can have that guarantee,
because the code that I write in the <span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> class is the only code
that will ever directly affect the values of the variables.</p>


<p>So, we will make <span class="code">die1</span> and <span class="code">die2</span> private, and add instance
methods <span class="code">getDie1()</span> and <span class="code">getDie2()</span> to return the values of
<span class="code">die1</span> and <span class="code">die2</span>.  These are "getter" methods that get the
value of a member variable, and their names follow the convention that the name of
a getter method consists of "get" followed by a capitalized version of the variable name.
It would still be useful to be able to set the values of the dice, but we want to
make it impossible to set the value to anything outside the range 1 to 6.  The solution
is to provide "setter" methods that throw an exception when the value is illegal.
</p>


<p>I also added the <span class="code">toString()</span> method from <a href="../c5/s3.html#OOP.3.2">Subsection&nbsp;5.3.3</a>.
As for other improvements, I can foresee that
people who use my class will often be interested in the total on the dice, so
they will tend to say things like "<span class="code">dice.getDie1() + dice.getDie2()</span>" a
lot. If this is going to be done over and over, why not provide a method in the
class to do it? So, I added a method <span class="code">getTotal()</span> that returns
the total value showing on the two dice. The complete, modified
<span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> class is shown below.</p>


<p>(Here is another improvement that I thought about. We could modify the
<span class="code">roll()</span> method so that in addition to rolling the dice, it would also
return an <span class="ptype">int</span> value giving the total on the dice. For example, this
would allow us to replace "<span class="code">dice.roll(); val = dice.getTotal()</span>" with
"<span class="code">val = dice.roll()</span>". Since it's legal to call a function with a
subroutine call statement, we could still say "<span class="code">dice.roll()</span>" if we just
want to roll the dice without recording the total immediately. However, I
decided that it was a little clearer to leave this feature out.)</p>


<p>The main program is easy, especially since we've done the same problem
before without using objects (in <a href="../c3/ex1-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;3.1</a>).
Note how the pair of dice object is used. To test whether or not the
total on the dice is 2, I use the test "<span class="code">while (dice.getTotal() != 2)</span>".
Because of the <span class="code">toString()</span> method,
I just have to say say</p>


<pre>System.out.println("The dice come up " + dice );</pre>


<p>to show the numbers on the two dice.</p>
