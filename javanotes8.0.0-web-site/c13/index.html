<span class="start"><big>I</big>t's possible to program</span> a wide variety of GUI
applications using only the techniques covered in <a href="../c6/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>. In many
cases, the basic events, components, layouts, and graphics routines covered in
that chapter suffice. But the JavaFX graphical user interface library is far
richer than what we have seen so far, and it can be used to build highly
sophisticated applications. This chapter continues the study of JavaFX,
but still does not cover it fully.  Some advanced topics, such as support
for video and three-dimensional graphics, are not even mentioned.
Full coverage of JavaFX would require at least another
complete book.  However, this chapter should deepen your understanding
of JavaFX and GUI programming.</p>
