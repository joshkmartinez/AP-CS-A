<h2>Programming Exercises for Chapter 8</h2>
<hr class="break">
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> several exercises for Chapter 8
        in <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.  For each exercise, a link to
        a possible solution is provided.   Each solution includes a discussion of how a programmer might approach the
        problem and interesting points raised by the problem or its solution, as well as complete source
        code of the solution.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 8.1:</h3>
<p>Write a program that uses
the following subroutine, from <a href="../c8/s3.html#robustness.3.3">Subsection&nbsp;8.3.3</a>, to solve
equations specified by the user.</p>

<pre>/**
 * Returns the larger of the two roots of the quadratic equation
 * A*x*x + B*x + C = 0, provided it has any roots.  If A == 0 or
 * if the discriminant, B*B - 4*A*C, is negative, then an exception
 * of type IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
 */
static public double root( double A, double B, double C ) 
                              throws IllegalArgumentException {
    if (A == 0) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("A can't be zero.");
    }
    else {
       double disc = B*B - 4*A*C;
       if (disc &lt; 0)
          throw new IllegalArgumentException("Discriminant &lt; zero.");
       return  (-B + Math.sqrt(disc)) / (2*A);
    }
}</pre>

<p>Your program should allow the user to specify values for <span class="code">A</span>,
<span class="code">B</span>, and <span class="code">C</span>. It should call the subroutine to compute a solution
of the equation. If no error occurs, it should print the root. However, if an
error occurs, your program should catch that error and print an error message.
After processing one equation, the program should ask whether the user wants to
enter another equation. The program should continue until the user answers
no.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 8.2:</h3>
<p>As discussed in <a href="../c8/s1.html">Section&nbsp;8.1</a>,
values of type <span class="ptype">int</span> are limited to 32 bits.
Integers that are too large to be represented in 32 bits cannot be stored in an
<span class="ptype">int</span> variable. Java has a standard class,
<span class="code">java.math.BigInteger</span>, that addresses this problem. An object of type
<span class="classname">BigInteger</span> is an integer that can be arbitrarily large. (The maximum
size is limited only by the amount of memory available to the Java Virtual Machine.) Since
<span class="classname">BigIntegers</span> are objects, they must be manipulated using instance
methods from the <span class="classname">BigInteger</span> class. For example, you can't add two
<span class="classname">BigIntegers</span> with the <span class="code">+</span> operator. Instead, if <span class="code">N</span> and
<span class="code">M</span> are variables that refer to <span class="classname">BigIntegers</span>, you can compute
the sum of <span class="code">N</span> and <span class="code">M</span> with the function call <span class="code">N.add(M)</span>.
The value returned by this function is a new <span class="classname">BigInteger</span> object that is
equal to the sum of <span class="code">N</span> and <span class="code">M</span>.</p>


<p>The <span class="classname">BigInteger</span> class has a constructor 
<span class="code">new BigInteger(str)</span>, where <span class="code">str</span> is a string.
The string must represent an integer, such as "3" or "39849823783783283733". If
the string does not represent a legal integer, then the constructor throws a
<span class="classname">NumberFormatException</span>.</p>


<p>There are many instance methods in the <span class="classname">BigInteger</span> class. Here are a
few that you will find useful for this exercise. Assume that <span class="code">N</span> and
<span class="code">M</span> are variables of type <span class="code">BigInteger</span>.</p>


<ul>

<li>
<span class="codedef">N.add(M)</span> &mdash; a function that returns a
<span class="classname">BigInteger</span> representing the sum of <span class="code">N</span> and <span class="code">M</span>.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">N.multiply(M)</span> &mdash; a function that
returns a <span class="classname">BigInteger</span> representing the result of multiplying <span class="code">N</span>
times <span class="code">M</span>.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">N.divide(M)</span> &mdash; a function that returns
a <span class="classname">BigInteger</span> representing the result of dividing <span class="code">N</span> by
<span class="code">M</span>, discarding the remainder.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">N.signum()</span> &mdash; a function that returns
an ordinary <span class="ptype">int</span>. The returned value represents the sign of the integer
<span class="code">N</span>. The returned value is 1 if <span class="code">N</span> is greater than zero. It is
-1 if <span class="code">N</span> is less than zero. And it is 0 if <span class="code">N</span> is zero.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">N.equals(M)</span> &mdash; a function that returns
a <span class="ptype">boolean</span> value that is <span class="code">true</span> if <span class="code">N</span> and <span class="code">M</span>
have the same integer value.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">N.toString()</span> &mdash; a function that
returns a <span class="classname">String</span> representing the value of <span class="code">N</span>.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">N.testBit(k)</span> &mdash; a function that
returns a <span class="ptype">boolean</span> value. The parameter <span class="code">k</span> is an integer. The
return value is <span class="code">true</span> if the <span class="code">k</span>-th bit in <span class="code">N</span> is 1, and
it is <span class="code">false</span> if the <span class="code">k</span>-th bit is 0. Bits are numbered from
right to left, starting with 0. Testing "<span class="code">if&nbsp;(N.testBit(0))</span>" is an easy
way to check whether <span class="code">N</span> is even or odd. <span class="code">N.testBit(0)</span> is
<span class="code">true</span> if and only if <span class="code">N</span> is an odd number.</li>

</ul>


<p>For this exercise, you should write a program that prints <span class="code">3N+1</span>
sequences with starting values specified by the user. In this version of the
program, you should use <span class="classname">BigIntegers</span> to represent the terms in the
sequence. You can read the user's input into a <span class="classname">String</span> with the
<span class="code">TextIO.getln()</span> function or with the <span class="code">nextLine()</span> function
of a <span class="classname">Scanner</span>. Use the input value to create the
<span class="classname">BigInteger</span> object that represents the starting point of the
<span class="code">3N+1</span> sequence. Don't forget to catch and handle the
<span class="classname">NumberFormatException</span> that will occur if the user's input is not a
legal integer!  The program should not end when that happens; it should just output
an error message.  You should also check that the input number is greater than
zero.</p>


<p>If the user's input is legal, print out the <span class="code">3N+1</span> sequence. Count
the number of terms in the sequence, and print the count at the end of the
sequence. Exit the program when the user inputs an empty line.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 8.3:</h3>
<p>A Roman numeral represents
an integer using letters. Examples are XVII to represent 17, MCMLIII for 1953,
and MMMCCCIII for 3303. By contrast, ordinary numbers such as 17 or 1953 are
called Arabic numerals. The following table shows the Arabic equivalent of all
the single-letter Roman numerals:</p>


<pre>M    1000            X   10
D     500            V    5
C     100            I    1
L      50</pre>


<p>When letters are strung together, the values of the letters are just added
up, with the following exception. When a letter of smaller value is followed by
a letter of larger value, the smaller value is subtracted from the larger
value. For example, IV represents 5&nbsp;-&nbsp;1, or 4. And MCMXCV is interpreted as 
M&nbsp;+&nbsp;CM&nbsp;+&nbsp;XC&nbsp;+&nbsp;V, 
or 1000&nbsp;+ (1000&nbsp;-&nbsp;100) + (100&nbsp;-&nbsp;10)&nbsp;+&nbsp;5, which is 1995. In
standard Roman numerals, no more than three consecutive copies of the same
letter are used. Following these rules, every number between 1 and 3999 can be
represented as a Roman numeral made up of the following one- and two-letter
combinations:</p>


<pre>M    1000            X   10
CM    900            IX   9
D     500            V    5
CD    400            IV   4
C     100            I    1
XC     90
L      50
XL     40</pre>


<p>Write a class to represent Roman numerals. The class should have two
constructors. One constructs a Roman numeral from a string such as "XVII" or
"MCMXCV". It should throw a <span class="classname">NumberFormatException</span> if the string is not
a legal Roman numeral. The other constructor constructs a Roman numeral from an
<span class="ptype">int</span>. It should throw a <span class="classname">NumberFormatException</span> if the
<span class="ptype">int</span> is outside the range 1 to 3999.</p>


<p>In addition, the class should have two instance methods. The method
<span class="code">toString()</span> returns the string that represents the Roman numeral. The
method <span class="code">toInt()</span> returns the value of the Roman numeral as an
<span class="ptype">int</span>.</p>


<p>At some point in your class, you will have to convert an <span class="ptype">int</span> into
the string that represents the corresponding Roman numeral. One way to approach
this is to gradually "move" value from the Arabic numeral to the Roman numeral.
Here is the beginning of a routine that will do this, where <span class="code">number</span> is
the <span class="ptype">int</span> that is to be converted:</p>


<pre>String roman = "";
int N = number;
while (N &gt;= 1000) {
      // Move 1000 from N to roman.
   roman += "M";
   N -= 1000;
}
while (N &gt;= 900) {
      // Move 900 from N to roman.
   roman += "CM";
   N -= 900;
}
.
.  // Continue with other values from the above table.
.</pre>


<p>(You can save yourself a lot of typing in this routine if you use arrays in
a clever way to represent the data in the above table.)</p>


<p>Once you've written your class, use it in a main program that will read both
Arabic numerals and Roman numerals entered by the user. If the user enters an
Arabic numeral, print the corresponding Roman numeral. If the user enters a
Roman numeral, print the corresponding Arabic numeral. (You can tell the
difference by using <span class="code">TextIO.peek()</span> to peek at the first character in
the user's input (see <a href="../c8/s2.html#robustness.2.2">Subsection&nbsp;8.2.2</a>). 
If the first character is a digit, then the user's input is an
Arabic numeral. Otherwise, it's a Roman numeral.) The program should end when
the user inputs an empty line.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 8.4:</h3>
<p>The source code file <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter8/Expr.java">Expr.java</a></span>
defines a class, <span class="classname">Expr</span>, that can be
used to represent mathematical expressions involving the variable <span class="code">x</span>.
The expression can use the operators <span class="code">+</span>, <span class="code">-</span>, <span class="code">*</span>, <span class="code">/</span>, 
and <span class="code">^</span> (where <span class="code">^</span> represents the
operation of raising a number to a power). It can use mathematical functions
such as <span class="code">sin</span>, <span class="code">cos</span>, <span class="code">abs</span>, and <span class="code">ln</span>. See the
source code file for full details. The <span class="classname">Expr</span> class uses some advanced
techniques which have not yet been covered in this textbook. However, the
interface is easy to understand. It contains only a constructor and two public
methods.</p>


<p>The constructor <span class="code">new Expr(def)</span> creates
an <span class="classname">Expr</span> object defined by a given expression. The parameter,
<span class="code">def</span>, is a string that contains the definition. For example, 
<span class="code">new&nbsp;Expr("x^2")</span> or <span class="code">new&nbsp;Expr("sin(x)+3*x")</span>. 
If the parameter in the
constructor call does not represent a legal expression, then the constructor
throws an <span class="classname">IllegalArgumentException</span>. The message in the exception
describes the error.</p>


<p>If <span class="code">func</span> is a variable of type <span class="code">Expr</span> and <span class="code">num</span> is of
type <span class="ptype">double</span>, then <span class="code">func.value(num)</span>
is a function that returns the value
of the expression when the number <span class="code">num</span> is substituted for the variable
<span class="code">x</span> in the expression. For example, if <span class="code">Expr</span> represents the
expression <span class="code">3*x+1</span>, then <span class="code">func.value(5)</span> is <span class="code">3*5+1</span>, or
16. If the expression is undefined for the specified value of <span class="code">x</span>, then
the special value <span class="code">Double.NaN</span> is returned; no exception is thrown.</p>


<p>Finally, <span class="code">func.toString()</span> returns
the definition of the expression. This is just the string that was used in the
constructor that created the expression object.</p>


<p>For this exercise, you should write a program that lets the user enter an
expression. If the expression contains an error, print an error message.
Otherwise, let the user enter some numerical values for the variable
<span class="code">x</span>. Print the value of the expression for each number that the user
enters. However, if the expression is undefined for the specified value of
<span class="code">x</span>, print a message to that effect. You can use the
<span class="ptype">boolean</span>-valued function <span class="code">Double.isNaN(val)</span> to check whether a
number, <span class="code">val</span>, is <span class="code">Double.NaN</span>.</p>


<p>The user should be able to enter as many values of <span class="code">x</span> as desired.
After that, the user should be able to enter a new expression.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 8.5:</h3>
<p>This exercise uses the
class <span class="classname">Expr</span>, which was described in
<a href="../c8/ex4-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;8.4</a> and which is defined in the source code
file <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter8/Expr.java">Expr.java</a></span>.  For this exercise, you
should write a GUI program that can graph a function, <span class="code">f(x)</span>, whose
definition is entered by the user. The program should have a text-input box
where the user can enter an expression involving the variable <span class="code">x</span>, such
as <span class="code">x^2</span> or <span class="code">sin(x-3)/x</span>. This expression is the definition of
the function. When the user clicks an "Enter" button or presses return, the program
should use the contents of the text input box to construct an object of type
<span class="classname">Expr</span>. If an error is found in the definition, then the program should
display an error message. Otherwise, it should display a graph of the function.
(Recall: If you make a button into the default button for the window, then pressing
return will be equivalent to clicking the button (see the end of <a href="../c6/s4.html#GUI1.4.2">Subsection&nbsp;6.4.2</a>).)</p>


<p>The program will need a <span class="classname">Canvas</span> for displaying the graph. To keep
things simple, the canvas should represent a fixed region in the xy-plane,
defined by <span class="code">-5&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;x&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;5</span> and
<span class="code">-5&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;y&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;5</span>. To draw the graph, compute a
large number of points and connect them with line segments. (This method does
not handle discontinuous functions properly; doing so is very hard, so you
shouldn't try to do it for this exercise.) My program divides the interval
<span class="code">-5&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;x&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;5</span> into 300 subintervals and uses
the 301 endpoints of these subintervals for drawing the graph. Note that the
function might be undefined at one of these <span class="code">x</span>-values. In that case,
you have to skip that point.</p>


<p>A point on the graph has the form <span class="code">(x,y)</span> where <span class="code">y</span> is
obtained by evaluating the user's expression at the given value of <span class="code">x</span>.
You will have to convert x and y values in the range from -5 to 5 to the
pixel coordinates that you need for drawing on the canvas.
The formulas for the conversion are:</p>


<pre>double a  =  ( (x + 5)/10 * width );
double b  =  ( (5 - y)/10 * height );</pre>


<p>where <span class="code">a</span> and <span class="code">b</span> are the horizontal and vertical coordinates
that you can use for drawing on the canvas.  The values of <span class="code">width</span> and <span class="code">height</span> 
give the size of the canvas.</p>
