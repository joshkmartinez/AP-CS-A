<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 8.1:</h3>
<p>Write a program that uses
the following subroutine, from <a href="../c8/s3.html#robustness.3.3">Subsection&nbsp;8.3.3</a>, to solve
equations specified by the user.</p>

<pre>/**
 * Returns the larger of the two roots of the quadratic equation
 * A*x*x + B*x + C = 0, provided it has any roots.  If A == 0 or
 * if the discriminant, B*B - 4*A*C, is negative, then an exception
 * of type IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
 */
static public double root( double A, double B, double C ) 
                              throws IllegalArgumentException {
    if (A == 0) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("A can't be zero.");
    }
    else {
       double disc = B*B - 4*A*C;
       if (disc &lt; 0)
          throw new IllegalArgumentException("Discriminant &lt; zero.");
       return  (-B + Math.sqrt(disc)) / (2*A);
    }
}</pre>

<p>Your program should allow the user to specify values for <span class="code">A</span>,
<span class="code">B</span>, and <span class="code">C</span>. It should call the subroutine to compute a solution
of the equation. If no error occurs, it should print the root. However, if an
error occurs, your program should catch that error and print an error message.
After processing one equation, the program should ask whether the user wants to
enter another equation. The program should continue until the user answers
no.</p>

<p>This is really just a fairly easy exercise in using exceptions. The
<span class="code">root()</span> subroutine must be called in a <span class="code">try..catch</span> statement. There
must be a <span class="code">catch</span> clause to handle the <span class="classname">IllegalArgumentException</span>
that might be thrown by the routine. The catch clause can simply print an error
message:</p>


<pre>try {
   solution = root(A,B,C);
   System.out.println("A solution of the equation is " + solution);
}
catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
   System.out.println("Sorry, I can't find a solution.");
   System.out.println(e.getMessage());
}</pre>


<p>Note that I've put the output statement that prints the solution inside the
<span class="code">try</span> statement. If an <span class="code">IllegalArgumentException</span> is thrown by
the subroutine, then this output statement will not be executed since the
computer will jump immediately to the <span class="code">catch</span> clause. You have to be
careful about things like this. It wouldn't do to have the output statement
after the <span class="code">try..catch</span> statement, since then the computer would still
try to execute the output statement after handling an
<span class="classname">IllegalArgumentException</span>. There are other ways to deal with this
problem. For example, since the <span class="code">try..catch</span> statement occurs in a
<span class="code">while</span> loop, we could put a <span class="code">continue</span> statement in the
<span class="code">catch</span> clause to abort further processing when an exception occurs:</p>

<pre>try {
   solution = root(A,B,C);
}
catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
   System.out.println("Sorry, I can't find a solution.");
   System.out.println(e.getMessage());
   continue;  // jump back to start of the while loop.
}

/* We only get to this point if NO exception was thrown.
   So we know that the solution was computed successfully. */

System.out.println("A solution of the equation is " + solution);</pre>

<p>The rest of the main program is pretty standard. A complete solution is
shown below.</p>
