<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 8.5</h2>

<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 8.5:</h3>
<p>This exercise uses the
class <span class="classname">Expr</span>, which was described in
<a href="../c8/ex4-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;8.4</a> and which is defined in the source code
file <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter8/Expr.java">Expr.java</a></span>.  For this exercise, you
should write a GUI program that can graph a function, <span class="code">f(x)</span>, whose
definition is entered by the user. The program should have a text-input box
where the user can enter an expression involving the variable <span class="code">x</span>, such
as <span class="code">x^2</span> or <span class="code">sin(x-3)/x</span>. This expression is the definition of
the function. When the user clicks an "Enter" button or presses return, the program
should use the contents of the text input box to construct an object of type
<span class="classname">Expr</span>. If an error is found in the definition, then the program should
display an error message. Otherwise, it should display a graph of the function.
(Recall: If you make a button into the default button for the window, then pressing
return will be equivalent to clicking the button (see the end of <a href="../c6/s4.html#GUI1.4.2">Subsection&nbsp;6.4.2</a>).)</p>


<p>The program will need a <span class="classname">Canvas</span> for displaying the graph. To keep
things simple, the canvas should represent a fixed region in the xy-plane,
defined by <span class="code">-5&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;x&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;5</span> and
<span class="code">-5&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;y&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;5</span>. To draw the graph, compute a
large number of points and connect them with line segments. (This method does
not handle discontinuous functions properly; doing so is very hard, so you
shouldn't try to do it for this exercise.) My program divides the interval
<span class="code">-5&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;x&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;5</span> into 300 subintervals and uses
the 301 endpoints of these subintervals for drawing the graph. Note that the
function might be undefined at one of these <span class="code">x</span>-values. In that case,
you have to skip that point.</p>


<p>A point on the graph has the form <span class="code">(x,y)</span> where <span class="code">y</span> is
obtained by evaluating the user's expression at the given value of <span class="code">x</span>.
You will have to convert x and y values in the range from -5 to 5 to the
pixel coordinates that you need for drawing on the canvas.
The formulas for the conversion are:</p>


<pre>double a  =  ( (x + 5)/10 * width );
double b  =  ( (5 - y)/10 * height );</pre>


<p>where <span class="code">a</span> and <span class="code">b</span> are the horizontal and vertical coordinates
that you can use for drawing on the canvas.  The values of <span class="code">width</span> and <span class="code">height</span> 
give the size of the canvas.</p>

<div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr>

<p>I wrote my solution using a nested subclass, <span class="classname">GraphCanvas</span>,
of <span class="classname">Canvas</span> to represent the canvas where the
function is graphed.  The subclass has an instance
variable, <span class="code">func</span>, of type <span class="classname">Expr</span> that represents the function to
be drawn, with a setter method that can be called to change the function.
The value of <span class="code">func</span> can be set to <span class="code">null</span> to indicate that no
function is available to be graphed. This will be true in the program
when the user's input has been found to be
illegal. The subclass has a <span class="code">draw()</span> method that checks the value of <span class="code">func</span>
to decide what to draw; this method is called in the constructor and whenever the
function is changed.  If <span class="code">func</span> is <span class="code">null</span>, then the <span class="code">draw()</span>
method simply draws a message on the panel stating that no function is
available. Otherwise, it draws a pair of axes and the graph of the
function, and it displays the definition of the function as a string.</p>


<p>The interesting work in class <span class="classname">GraphCanvas</span> is done in the
<span class="code">drawFunction()</span> method, which is called by
<span class="code">draw()</span>. This function draws the graph of the function
for <span class="code">-5 &lt;= x &lt;= 5</span>. This interval on the <span class="code">x</span> axis is
divided into 300 subintervals. Since the length of the interval is 10, the
length of each subinterval is given by <span class="code">dx</span>, where <span class="code">dx</span> is
<span class="code">10.0/300</span>. The <span class="code">x</span> values for the points that I want to plot are
given by <span class="code">-5</span>, <span class="code">-5+dx</span>, <span class="code">-5+2*dx</span>, and so on. Each
<span class="code">x</span>-value is obtained by adding <span class="code">dx</span> to the previous value. For
each <span class="code">x</span> value, the <span class="code">y</span>-value of the point on the graph is
computed as <span class="code">func.value(x)</span>. As the points on the graph are computed,
line segments are drawn to connect pairs of points (unless the <span class="code">y</span>-value
of either point is undefined). An algorithm for the <span class="code">drawFunction()</span>
method is:</p>


<pre>Let dx = 10.0 / 300;
Let x = -5                // Get the first point
Let y = func.value(x)
for i = 1 to 300:
    Let prevx = x         // Save the previous point
    Let prevy = y
    Let x = x + dx        // Get the next point
    Let y = func.value(x)
    if neither y nor prevy is Double.NaN:
       draw a line segment from (prevx,prevy) to (x,y)</pre>


<p>The method for drawing the line segment uses the conversion from graphing coordinates 
to pixel coordinates that is given in the exercise. By the
way, more general conversion formulas can be given in the case where <span class="code">x</span>
extends from <span class="code">xmin</span> to <span class="code">xmax</span> and <span class="code">y</span> extends from
<span class="code">ymin</span> to <span class="code">ymax</span>. The general formulas are:</p>


<pre>a  =  ( (x - xmin) / (xmax - xmin) * width );
b  =  ( (ymax - y) / (ymax - ymin) * height );</pre>


<p>The formulas for <span class="code">a</span> and <span class="code">b</span> are of slightly different form to
reflect the fact that <span class="code">a</span> increases from 0 to <span class="code">width</span> as
<span class="code">x</span> increases from <span class="code">xmin</span> to <span class="code">xmax</span>, while <span class="code">b</span>
<b>decreases</b> from <span class="code">height</span> to 0 as <span class="code">y</span> increases
from <span class="code">ymin</span> to <span class="code">ymax</span>. You could improve the program by adding
text input boxes where the user can enter values for <span class="code">xmin</span>,
<span class="code">xmax</span>, <span class="code">ymin</span>, and <span class="code">ymax</span>.</p>


<p>The constructor for the <span class="classname">GraphCanvas</span> takes a parameter
of type <span class="classname">Expr</span> that specifies an initial function to be
graphed when the canvas is first created (or the parameter could be <span class="code">null</span>
if no initial function is to be displayed).  I use this feature in my program
to show a sample function when the program starts.</p>


<p>In the <span class="code">start()</span> method, a <span class="classname">BorderPane</span> is used
for the root of the scene graph.  The center component is the large canvas
that is used for graphing.  A <span class="classname">Label</span> is placed in the
top position; the label is used to display messages to the user, including
error messages when the user's input is not valid.  The bottom component
is an <span class="classname">HBox</span> that contains the text input box for the
user's input and the "Enter" button.  I also added a label in front of
the text input box that says "f(x)&nbsp;=".  I did a great deal of tweaking
of the user interface, using techniques from <a href="../c6/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>,
but since this chapter is not about GUI programming, I won't discuss the
tweaks here.  You can check out the source code below to see what I did.
Here is what the program window looks like when it first appears on the
screen:</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="SimpleGrapher.png" width="405" height="458" alt="The SimpleGrapher program window"></p>


<p>The start method also installs an <span class="code">ActionEvent</span> handler for
the button, written as a long lambda expression.  The handler gets the
string from the <span class="code">TextField</span>. It tries to use this string to construct
an object of type <span class="code">Expr</span>. The constructor throws an
<span class="code">IllegalArgumentException</span> if the string contains an error, so the
constructor is called in a <span class="code">try</span> statement that can catch and handle the
error. If an error occurs, then the error message in the exception object is
displayed in the <span class="code">Label</span> at the top of the window, and the graph is
cleared. If no error occurs, the graph is set to display the user's function,
and the <span class="code">Label</span> is set to display the generic message, "Enter a
function and click Enter or press return." The code for all this is:</p>


<pre>Expr function;  // The user's function.
  
try {
    String def = functionInput.getText();
    function = new Expr(def);
    graph.setFunction(function);
    message.setText(" Enter a function and press return.");
}
catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
    graph.clearFunction();
    message.setText(e.getMessage());
}</pre>

/**
   The SimpleGrapher program can draw graphs of functions input by the
   user.  The user enters the definition of the function in a text
   input box.  When the user presses return or clicks the "Enter" button,
   the function is graphed.  (Unless the definition contains an error.  
   In that case, an error message is displayed.)

   The graph is drawn on a canvas which represents the region of the
   (x,y)-plane given by  -5 &lt;= x &lt;= 5  and  -5 &lt;= y &lt;= 5.  Any part of
   the graph that lies outside this region is not shown.  The graph
   is drawn by plotting 301 points and joining them with lines.  This
   does not handle discontinuous functions properly.
   
   An example function is graphed when the program starts.

   This program requires the class Expr, which is defined in by a 
   separate file, Expr.java.  That file contains a full description 
   of the syntax of legal function definitions, but the program
   understands operators +, -, *, /, and ^ (where ^ represents
   exponentiation), as well as common mathematical functions 
   such as sin(x) and ln(x).
