<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 8.3:</h3>
<p>A Roman numeral represents
an integer using letters. Examples are XVII to represent 17, MCMLIII for 1953,
and MMMCCCIII for 3303. By contrast, ordinary numbers such as 17 or 1953 are
called Arabic numerals. The following table shows the Arabic equivalent of all
the single-letter Roman numerals:</p>


<pre>M    1000            X   10
D     500            V    5
C     100            I    1
L      50</pre>


<p>When letters are strung together, the values of the letters are just added
up, with the following exception. When a letter of smaller value is followed by
a letter of larger value, the smaller value is subtracted from the larger
value. For example, IV represents 5&nbsp;-&nbsp;1, or 4. And MCMXCV is interpreted as 
M&nbsp;+&nbsp;CM&nbsp;+&nbsp;XC&nbsp;+&nbsp;V, 
or 1000&nbsp;+ (1000&nbsp;-&nbsp;100) + (100&nbsp;-&nbsp;10)&nbsp;+&nbsp;5, which is 1995. In
standard Roman numerals, no more than three consecutive copies of the same
letter are used. Following these rules, every number between 1 and 3999 can be
represented as a Roman numeral made up of the following one- and two-letter
combinations:</p>


<pre>M    1000            X   10
CM    900            IX   9
D     500            V    5
CD    400            IV   4
C     100            I    1
XC     90
L      50
XL     40</pre>


<p>Write a class to represent Roman numerals. The class should have two
constructors. One constructs a Roman numeral from a string such as "XVII" or
"MCMXCV". It should throw a <span class="classname">NumberFormatException</span> if the string is not
a legal Roman numeral. The other constructor constructs a Roman numeral from an
<span class="ptype">int</span>. It should throw a <span class="classname">NumberFormatException</span> if the
<span class="ptype">int</span> is outside the range 1 to 3999.</p>


<p>In addition, the class should have two instance methods. The method
<span class="code">toString()</span> returns the string that represents the Roman numeral. The
method <span class="code">toInt()</span> returns the value of the Roman numeral as an
<span class="ptype">int</span>.</p>


<p>At some point in your class, you will have to convert an <span class="ptype">int</span> into
the string that represents the corresponding Roman numeral. One way to approach
this is to gradually "move" value from the Arabic numeral to the Roman numeral.
Here is the beginning of a routine that will do this, where <span class="code">number</span> is
the <span class="ptype">int</span> that is to be converted:</p>


<pre>String roman = "";
int N = number;
while (N &gt;= 1000) {
      // Move 1000 from N to roman.
   roman += "M";
   N -= 1000;
}
while (N &gt;= 900) {
      // Move 900 from N to roman.
   roman += "CM";
   N -= 900;
}
.
.  // Continue with other values from the above table.
.</pre>


<p>(You can save yourself a lot of typing in this routine if you use arrays in
a clever way to represent the data in the above table.)</p>


<p>Once you've written your class, use it in a main program that will read both
Arabic numerals and Roman numerals entered by the user. If the user enters an
Arabic numeral, print the corresponding Roman numeral. If the user enters a
Roman numeral, print the corresponding Arabic numeral. (You can tell the
difference by using <span class="code">TextIO.peek()</span> to peek at the first character in
the user's input (see <a href="../c8/s2.html#robustness.2.2">Subsection&nbsp;8.2.2</a>). 
If the first character is a digit, then the user's input is an
Arabic numeral. Otherwise, it's a Roman numeral.) The program should end when
the user inputs an empty line.</p>

<p>My class is called <span class="classname">RomanNumeral</span>. An object of type
<span class="classname">RomanNumeral</span> has a <span class="code">private</span> instance variable of type
<span class="ptype">int</span> that stores the integer value of the Roman numeral. When the
<span class="code">toString()</span> method is called, it computes the string that represents
the Roman number based on the value of this <span class="ptype">int</span>. By contrast, the
<span class="code">toInt()</span> method simply returns the value of the instance variable. This
is not the only way that things could be done. I might have stored the string
representation of the Roman numeral in an instance variable. In that case, the
<span class="code">toString()</span> method would simply return the stored value, while the
<span class="code">toInt()</span> method would have to compute the <span class="ptype">int</span> value from the
stored <span class="classname">String</span>. It would also be possible, and more efficient, to store both the
<span class="ptype">int</span> and <span class="classname">String</span> representations in the object. (The point,
though, is that it's not necessary to do so. The two representations hold
exactly the same information.)</p>


<p>In my version of the class, the constructor which takes a parameter of type
<span class="ptype">int</span> simply has to store the parameter value in the instance variable,
after checking that it is in the legal range of values.</p>


<p>The constructor that takes a parameter of type <span class="classname">String</span> must
interpret the string as a Roman numeral and convert it to the corresponding
<span class="ptype">int</span> value. This is done by adding up the integer value associated with
each character or pair of characters in the string. The fact that characters
sometimes need to be considered in pairs complicates things a bit. An algorithm
for converting a <span class="classname">String</span>, <span class="code">roman</span>, to an <span class="ptype">int</span>,
<span class="code">arabic</span>, is:</p>


<pre>Let arabic = 0
Let i = 0  // representing a position in the string

while i is a legal position in the string:
    Let ch be the character in position i
    Let N be the numeric equivalent of ch
    i++   // to account for the character, ch
    if there are no additional characters in the string:
          // (We need to make this test first, to avoid an error
          // when we try to look at the next character.)
       Add N to arabic
    else:   // Try pairing the ch with the next character
       Let N2 be the numeric equivalent of the NEXT character
       If N &lt; N2:  // Evaluate the characters as a pair
           Add (N2 - N) to arabic
           i++    // to account for the extra character
       else:
           Add N to arabic</pre>


<p>This algorithm does not take into account that the string might not be a
legal Roman numeral. If a character in the string is not one of the characters
M, D, C, L, X, V, or I, then a <span class="classname">NumberFormatException</span> must be
thrown.  And the algorithm allows some unusual two-letter combinations such as
IM to represent 999; it is not clear whether these should be considered to be errors.</p>


<p>The job of converting an <span class="ptype">int</span> into an equivalent Roman numeral is
handled in my <span class="code">toString()</span> method. The exercise includes code that shows how to write this
method as a long sequence of <span class="code">while</span> loops. Consider the loop</p>


<pre>while (N &gt;= 1000) {
   roman += "M";
   N -= 1000;
}</pre>


<p>After this loop, all the 1000's in <span class="code">N</span> have been converted to M's in
<span class="code">roman</span>, and we can be sure that <span class="code">N</span> is 999 or less. So what's
left of <span class="code">N</span> can be expressed in terms of the smaller numbers in the
table: 900, 500, 400, and so on. Each of these numbers can be processed by a
<span class="code">while</span> loop (although an if statement would also work in some cases, where
the number that is being tested can only occur once.). 
Note that the numbers in these loops must be in decreasing
order for this to work.</p>


<p>However, all the loops in this algorithm have the same form. They just use
different numbers and letters. In my program, I use two arrays to store the
numbers and letters from the table:</p>


<pre>private static int[]    numbers = { 1000,  900,  500,  400,  100,   90,  
                                      50,   40,   10,    9,    5,    4,    1 };
                                   
private static String[] letters = { "M",  "CM",  "D",  "CD", "C",  "XC",
                                    "L",  "XL",  "X",  "IX", "V",  "IV", "I" };</pre>


<p>For each index <span class="code">i</span>, <span class="code">numbers[i]</span> is the <span class="ptype">int</span>
equivalent of the Roman numeral <span class="code">letters[i]</span>. All the processing can
then be done with a <span class="code">for</span> loop that does all the required <span class="code">while</span>
loops one after the other:</p>


<pre>public String toString() {
      // Return the standard representation of this Roman numeral.
   String roman = "";  // The Roman numeral.
   int N = num;        // N represents the part of num that still has
                       //   to be converted to Roman numeral representation.
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; numbers.length; i++) {
      while (N &gt;= numbers[i]) {
         roman += letters[i];
         N -= numbers[i];
      }
   }
   return roman;
}</pre>


<hr class="break">


<p>An algorithm for the main program is given by:</p>


<pre>while (true):
    Prompt the user for input
    If the first non-blank thing on the line is the end-of-line:
       break
    else if the first character on the line is a digit:
       Let arabic = TextIO.getlnInt()
       Let roman = new RomanNumeral(arabic)
       Print out roman.toString()
    else:
       Let str = TextIO.getln();
       Let roman = new RomanNumeral(str);
       Print out roman.toInt();</pre>


<p>This algorithm ignores the possibility that the user's input might be
illegal. If it is, then the <span class="classname">RomanNumeral</span> constructor will throw a
<span class="classname">NumberFormatException</span>. This exception must be caught and handled. With
this in mind, the algorithm becomes:</p>


<pre>while (true):
    Prompt the user for input
    If the first non-blank thing on the line is the end-of-line:
       break
    else if the first character on the line is a digit:
       Let arabic = TextIO.getlnInt()
       try {
          Let roman = new RomanNumeral(arabic)
          Print out roman.toString()
       }
       catch (NumberFormatException e) {
          Print an error message
       }
    else:
       Let str = TextIO.getln();
       try {
          Let roman = new RomanNumeral(str);
          Print out roman.toInt();
       }
       catch (NumberFormatException e) {
          Print an error message
       }</pre>


<p>This can be easily coded into Java. By the way, the test as to whether the
first character on the input line is a digit can be performed using the
standard <span class="ptype">boolean</span>-valued function <span class="code">Character.isDigit(ch)</span>, which
returns <span class="code">true</span> if the character <span class="code">ch</span> is a digit.</p>
