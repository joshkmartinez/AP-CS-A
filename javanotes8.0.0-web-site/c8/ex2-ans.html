<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 8.2</h2>

<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 8.2:</h3>
<p>As discussed in <a href="../c8/s1.html">Section&nbsp;8.1</a>,
values of type <span class="ptype">int</span> are limited to 32 bits.
Integers that are too large to be represented in 32 bits cannot be stored in an
<span class="ptype">int</span> variable. Java has a standard class,
<span class="code">java.math.BigInteger</span>, that addresses this problem. An object of type
<span class="classname">BigInteger</span> is an integer that can be arbitrarily large. (The maximum
size is limited only by the amount of memory available to the Java Virtual Machine.) Since
<span class="classname">BigIntegers</span> are objects, they must be manipulated using instance
methods from the <span class="classname">BigInteger</span> class. For example, you can't add two
<span class="classname">BigIntegers</span> with the <span class="code">+</span> operator. Instead, if <span class="code">N</span> and
<span class="code">M</span> are variables that refer to <span class="classname">BigIntegers</span>, you can compute
the sum of <span class="code">N</span> and <span class="code">M</span> with the function call <span class="code">N.add(M)</span>.
The value returned by this function is a new <span class="classname">BigInteger</span> object that is
equal to the sum of <span class="code">N</span> and <span class="code">M</span>.</p>


<p>The <span class="classname">BigInteger</span> class has a constructor 
<span class="code">new BigInteger(str)</span>, where <span class="code">str</span> is a string.
The string must represent an integer, such as "3" or "39849823783783283733". If
the string does not represent a legal integer, then the constructor throws a
<span class="classname">NumberFormatException</span>.</p>


<p>There are many instance methods in the <span class="classname">BigInteger</span> class. Here are a
few that you will find useful for this exercise. Assume that <span class="code">N</span> and
<span class="code">M</span> are variables of type <span class="code">BigInteger</span>.</p>


<ul>

<li>
<span class="codedef">N.add(M)</span> &mdash; a function that returns a
<span class="classname">BigInteger</span> representing the sum of <span class="code">N</span> and <span class="code">M</span>.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">N.multiply(M)</span> &mdash; a function that
returns a <span class="classname">BigInteger</span> representing the result of multiplying <span class="code">N</span>
times <span class="code">M</span>.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">N.divide(M)</span> &mdash; a function that returns
a <span class="classname">BigInteger</span> representing the result of dividing <span class="code">N</span> by
<span class="code">M</span>, discarding the remainder.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">N.signum()</span> &mdash; a function that returns
an ordinary <span class="ptype">int</span>. The returned value represents the sign of the integer
<span class="code">N</span>. The returned value is 1 if <span class="code">N</span> is greater than zero. It is
-1 if <span class="code">N</span> is less than zero. And it is 0 if <span class="code">N</span> is zero.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">N.equals(M)</span> &mdash; a function that returns
a <span class="ptype">boolean</span> value that is <span class="code">true</span> if <span class="code">N</span> and <span class="code">M</span>
have the same integer value.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">N.toString()</span> &mdash; a function that
returns a <span class="classname">String</span> representing the value of <span class="code">N</span>.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">N.testBit(k)</span> &mdash; a function that
returns a <span class="ptype">boolean</span> value. The parameter <span class="code">k</span> is an integer. The
return value is <span class="code">true</span> if the <span class="code">k</span>-th bit in <span class="code">N</span> is 1, and
it is <span class="code">false</span> if the <span class="code">k</span>-th bit is 0. Bits are numbered from
right to left, starting with 0. Testing "<span class="code">if&nbsp;(N.testBit(0))</span>" is an easy
way to check whether <span class="code">N</span> is even or odd. <span class="code">N.testBit(0)</span> is
<span class="code">true</span> if and only if <span class="code">N</span> is an odd number.</li>

</ul>


<p>For this exercise, you should write a program that prints <span class="code">3N+1</span>
sequences with starting values specified by the user. In this version of the
program, you should use <span class="classname">BigIntegers</span> to represent the terms in the
sequence. You can read the user's input into a <span class="classname">String</span> with the
<span class="code">TextIO.getln()</span> function or with the <span class="code">nextLine()</span> function
of a <span class="classname">Scanner</span>. Use the input value to create the
<span class="classname">BigInteger</span> object that represents the starting point of the
<span class="code">3N+1</span> sequence. Don't forget to catch and handle the
<span class="classname">NumberFormatException</span> that will occur if the user's input is not a
legal integer!  The program should not end when that happens; it should just output
an error message.  You should also check that the input number is greater than
zero.</p>


<p>If the user's input is legal, print out the <span class="code">3N+1</span> sequence. Count
the number of terms in the sequence, and print the count at the end of the
sequence. Exit the program when the user inputs an empty line.</p>

<p>My solution uses a subroutine, <span class="code">printThreeNSequence(N)</span>, to print out
the <span class="code">3N+1</span> sequence starting from the <span class="classname">BigInteger</span>, <span class="code">N</span>.
The subroutine assumes that <span class="code">N</span> is not <span class="code">null</span> and that it
represents a value that is greater than one.  Given these assumptions, the
subroutine cannot generate any errors. (These preconditions are ensured by
the main program which calls the subroutine, but I use <span class="code">assert</span>
statements to test the assumptions during debugging.)  The only interesting aspect of the
subroutine is that all operations on <span class="code">N</span> must be performed using
instance methods from the <span class="classname">BigInteger</span> class. For example, to multiply
<span class="code">N</span> by 2, I use a statement "<span class="code">N = N.multiply(TWO);</span>", where
<span class="code">TWO</span> is a <span class="classname">BigInteger</span> that represents the integer 2. My program
defines <span class="code">TWO</span> as a constant, along with several other
<span class="classname">BigIntegers</span> that represent values that I need:</p>


<pre>static final BigInteger THREE = new BigInteger("3");
static final BigInteger ONE = new BigInteger("1");
static final BigInteger TWO = new BigInteger("2");</pre>


<p>With these constants, the code for computing the next term in a
<span class="code">3N+1</span> sequence becomes:</p>


<pre>if (N.testBit(0) == false) {
        // N is even.  Divide N by 2.
    N = N.divide(TWO);
}
else {
        // N is odd.  Multiply N by 3, then add 1.
    N = N.multiply(THREE);
    N = N.add(ONE);
}</pre>


<p>You can find the complete subroutine in the solution that is given below.</p>


<p>In the <span class="code">main()</span> routine, the user's input is read into a variable,
<span class="code">line</span>, of type <span class="classname">String</span>. The input is used to construct a
<span class="classname">BigInteger</span> with the statement "<span class="code">N = new BigInteger(line);</span>".
Since this statement can produce a <span class="classname">NumberFormatException</span>, it is placed
in a <span class="code">try</span> statement that can catch and handle the error. The test
"<span class="code">if (N.signum() == 1)</span>" is used to make sure that <span class="code">N&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;1</span>.
The value of <span class="code">N.signum()</span> is 1 if and only if <span class="code">N</span> is a positive
integer. Here is the loop form the <span class="code">main()</span> routine that processes the
user's input (where <span class="code">scanner</span> is a <span class="classname">Scanner</span> that
reads from <span class="code">System.in</span>):</p>


<pre>while (true) {
   System.out.println();
   System.out.println("Enter the starting value, or press return to end.");
   System.out.print("? ");
   line = scanner.nextLine().trim();
   if (line.length() == 0)
       break;
   try {
       N = new BigInteger(line);
       if (N.signum() == 1)
          printThreeNSequence(N);
       else
          System.out.println("Error:  The starting value cannot be less than or equal to zero.");
   }
   catch (NumberFormatException e) {
       System.out.println("Error:  \"" + line + "\" is not a legal integer.");
   }
}</pre>


<p>Note that the user's input is read using "<span class="code">line = scanner.nextLine().trim()</span>.
The function <span class="code">trim()</span> that is applied to the input string will remove any spaces
that are at the start or the end of the string.  In the constructor <span class="code">new&nbsp;BigInteger(line)</span>,
no spaces are allowed in <span class="code">line</span>, but if the user types a space or two followed by a
legal number, I don't want my program to reject that as an error.  Using the <span class="code">trim()</span>
command will allow spaces before and after an otherwise legal number. Using
<span class="code">scanner.next()</span> instead of <span class="code">scanner.nextLine()</span> would be another
way to ignore spaces, but it would make it impossible to end the program when the user
enters an empty line because <span class="code">scanner.next()</span> just skips empty lines looking
for the next non-blank token.</p>
