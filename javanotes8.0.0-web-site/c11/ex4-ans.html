<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 11.4</h2>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 11.4:</h3>
<p>Write a client program
for the server from <a href="../c11/ex3-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;11.3</a>. Design a
user interface that will let the user do at least two things: (1)&nbsp;Get a list of
files that are available on the server and display the list on standard output; and
(2)&nbsp;Get a copy of a specified file from the server and save it to a local file (on
the computer where the client is running).</p>

<hr>
<div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr>
<p>One possible user interface would be to present the
user with a menu of actions that the program can perform. For variety,
however, I decided on an interface based entirely on the command line. The
first command line argument must be the name or IP address of the computer
where a copy of the <span class="classname">FileServer</span> program from 
<a href="../c11/ex3-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;11.3</a> is running. If that is the only
command-line argument, then the client will contact the server and send an
"index" command to the server. The server responds with a list of file names.
The client reads these names and displays them on the screen. The program then
ends. (If you want to give another command, you have to run the client program
again with a new command line.)</p>


<p>If there are two command-line arguments, then the second argument must be
the name of a file on the server. The client contacts the server and sends a
"GET" command. The server responds with a one-line message, either an "ERROR" or
"OK". The client reads this message. If the message starts with "ERROR", indicating that
the requested file can't be sent, then the client just displays an error
message to the user. If the message is "OK", then the server also sends the
contents of the file. The client tries to create a local file of the same name.
It reads the data from the server and saves it to that file. However, for
safety, the client will not create a new file if a local file of the same name
already exists. This is considered to be an error. (An alternative would be
to ask the user whether to replace the existing file.)</p>


<p>Finally, I wanted to make it possible to save a downloaded file in a local
file with a different name. For this, three command line arguments are used.
The first is the server, the second is the name of the file on the server, and
the third is the name of the local file where the downloaded file is to be
saved. In this case, the program is willing to overwrite an existing file of
the same name, so the command must be used with some care.</p>


<p>If the server program is running on the same computer as the client (for
demonstration purposes), the following command lines can be used to run the
client:</p>


<pre>java FileClient  localhost
java FileClient  localhost  datafile.txt
java FileClient  localhost  datafile.txt  mycopy.dat
java FileClient  localhost  datafile.txt  datafile.txt</pre>


<p>The first command shows a list of files that are available on the server.
The other three all try to get a file named "datafile.txt" from the server.
The second command would refuse the save the file, if a file named datafile.txt
already exists.  The last command would replace an existing datafile.txt with the file
retrieved from the server.</p>


<p>The actual programming of the client is fairly straightforward. The example
program <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter11/DateClient.java">DateClient.java</a></span>, from <a href="../c11/s4.html#IO.4.4">Subsection&nbsp;11.4.4</a> provides a
model for opening a connection to the server. You should be able to follow the solution, given
below.</p>
   

<p>Note that the client program must know the protocol that is used to communicate
with the server.  The <b>user</b> of the program, however, doesn't need to know
anything about the protocol.  The user only has to know how to use the program,
and the user interface does not reflect or depend on the details of the protocol.</p>


<p>By the way, once you understand how the <span class="classname">FileClient</span> and
<span class="classname">FileServer</span> examples work, it's not a big conceptual leap to
understanding how the World Wide Web works. A Web server program is just a
greatly souped-up version of the <span class="classname">FileServer</span> program. It has access to
a collection of files. It receives and responds to requests for those files
from client programs. To get a file, the client program&mdash;a Web browser&mdash;needs
to know the computer on which the server is running and the name of the
file. This information is encoded in the url address of a Web page&mdash;just like
it's given on the command line of the <span class="classname">FileClient</span> program. A Web page,
of course, can contain links to other Web pages. The link includes a url with
the necessary information for finding the page. To get the page, the Web
browser just goes through the same process of contacting the specified server
and requesting the specified file. (One big complication is that not all the
files on a Web server are text files, so the client needs some way of knowing
what type of data is stored in the file, and it needs to know how to handle
data of that type. Another complication is that Web servers support "server side
programming."  That is, in response to certain URLs, instead of just sending a
file, the Web server will run a program and send the output to the client.)</p>

/**
 * This program is a client for the FileServer server.  The 
 * server has a list of available text files that can be
 * downloaded by the client.  The client can also download
 * the list of files.  When the connection is opened, the
 * client sends one of two possible commands to the server:
 * "INDEX" or "GET &lt;file-name&gt;".  The server replies to
 * the first command by sending the list of available files.
 * It responds to the second with a one-line message,
 * either "OK" or "ERROR".  If the message is "ok", it is
 * followed by the contents of the file with the specified
 * name.  The "error" message indicates that the specified
 * file does not exist on the server.  (The server can also
 * respond with the message "unsupported command" if the command
 * it reads is not one of the two possible legal commands.)
 * 
 * The client program works with command-line arguments.
 * The first argument must be the name or IP address of the
 * computer where the server is running.  If that is the
 * only argument on the command line, then the client
 * gets the list of files from the server and displays
 * it on standard output.  If there are two parameters,
 * the second parameter is interpreted as the name of a
 * file to be downloaded.  A copy of the file is saved
 * as a local file of the same name, unless a file of
 * the same name already exists.  If there are three
 * arguments, the second is the name of the file to be
 * downloaded and the third is the name under which the
 * local copy of the file is to be saved.  This will
 * work even if a file of the same name already exists.
