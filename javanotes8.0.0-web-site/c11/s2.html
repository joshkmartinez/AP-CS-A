<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>he data and programs</span> in a computer's main memory
survive only as long as the power is on. For more permanent storage, computers
use <span class="newword">files</span>, which are collections of data stored on
a hard disk, on a USB memory stick, on a CD-ROM, or on some other type of storage
device. Files are organized into <span class="newword">directories</span>
(also called <span class="newword">folders</span>). A directory can hold other directories, as well
as files. Both directories and files have names that are used to identify
them.</p>


<p>Programs can read data from existing files. They can create new files and
can write data to files. In Java, such input and output can be done using I/O streams.
Human-readable character data can be read from a file using an object belonging to
the class <span class="classname">FileReader</span>, which is a subclass of <span class="classname">Reader</span>.
Similarly, data can be written to a file in human-readable format through an object
of type <span class="classname">FileWriter</span>, a subclass of <span class="classname">Writer</span>. For files that
store data in machine format, the appropriate I/O classes are
<span class="classname">FileInputStream</span> and <span class="classname">FileOutputStream</span>. In this section, I will
only discuss character-oriented file I/O using the <span class="classname">FileReader</span> and
<span class="classname">FileWriter</span> classes. However, <span class="classname">FileInputStream</span> and
<span class="classname">FileOutputStream</span> are used in an exactly parallel fashion. All these
classes are defined in the <span class="code">java.io</span> package.</p>



<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="IO.2.1">11.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading and Writing Files</a>
</h3>


<p>The <span class="classname">FileReader</span> class has a constructor which takes the name of a
file as a parameter and creates an input stream that can be used for reading
from that file. This constructor will throw an exception of type
<span class="classname">FileNotFoundException</span> if the file doesn't exist. 
For example, suppose you have a file named
"<span class="code">data.txt</span>", and you want your program to read data from that file. You
could do the following to create an input stream for the file:</p>


<pre>FileReader data;   // (Declare the variable before the
                   //   try statement, or else the variable
                   //   is local to the try block and you won't
                   //   be able to use it later in the program.)
                        
try {
   data = new FileReader("data.txt");  // create the stream
}
catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
   ... // do something to handle the error&mdash;maybe, end the program
}</pre>


<p>The <span class="classname">FileNotFoundException</span> class is a subclass of
<span class="classname">IOException</span>, so it would be acceptable to catch <span class="classname">IOExceptions</span>
in the above <span class="code">try...catch</span> statement. More generally, just about any
error that can occur during input/output operations can be caught by a
<span class="code">catch</span> clause that handles <span class="classname">IOException</span>.</p>


<p>Once you have successfully created a <span class="classname">FileReader</span>, you can start
reading data from it. But since <span class="classname">FileReaders</span> have only the primitive
input methods inherited from the basic <span class="classname">Reader</span> class, you will probably
want to wrap your <span class="classname">FileReader</span> in a <span class="classname">Scanner</span>, in
a <span class="classname">BufferedReader</span>, or in
some other wrapper class.  (See the <a href="../c11/s1.html#IO.1.4">previous section</a> for
a discussion of <span class="classname">BufferedReader</span> and <span class="classname">Scanner</span>.)
To create a <span class="classname">BufferedReader</span> for reading from a file named <span class="code">data.dat</span>,
you could say:</p>


<pre>BufferedReader data;

try {
   data = new BufferedReader( new FileReader("data.dat") );
}
catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
   ... // handle the exception
}</pre>


<p>Wrapping a <span class="classname">Reader</span> in a <span class="classname">BufferedReader</span>
lets you easily read lines of text from the file, and the buffering can make the input
more efficient.</p>


<p>To use a <span class="classname">Scanner</span> to read from the file, you can construct the
scanner in a similar way.  However, it is more common to construct it more directly from an object
of type <span class="classname">File</span> (to be covered <a href="../c11/s2.html#IO.2.2">below</a>):</p>


<pre>Scanner in;

try {
   in = new Scanner( new File("data.dat") );
}
catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
   ... // handle the exception
}</pre>



<p>Working with output files is no more difficult than this. You simply create
an object belonging to the class <span class="classname">FileWriter</span>. You will probably want to
wrap this output stream in an object of type <span class="classname">PrintWriter</span>. For example,
suppose you want to write data to a file named "<span class="code">result.dat</span>". Since the
constructor for <span class="classname">FileWriter</span> can throw an exception of type
<span class="classname">IOException</span>, you should use a <span class="code">try..catch</span> statement:</p>


<pre>PrintWriter result;

try {
   result = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter("result.dat"));
}
catch (IOException e) {
   ... // handle the exception
}</pre>


<p>However, as with <span class="classname">Scanner</span>, it is more common to use a
constructor that takes a <span class="classname">File</span> as parameter; this will
automatically wrap the File in a FileWriter before creating the PrintWriter:</p>


<pre>PrintWriter result;

try {
   result = new PrintWriter(new File("result.dat"));
}
catch (IOException e) {
   ... // handle the exception
}</pre>


<p>You can even use just a <span class="classname">String</span> as the parameter to the
constructor, and it will be interpreted as a file name (but you should remember that
a <span class="classname">String</span> in the <span class="classname">Scanner</span> constructor
does not name a file; instead the file will read characters from the string itself).</p>


<p>If no file named <span class="code">result.dat</span> exists, a new file will be created. If
the file already exists, then the current contents of the file will be erased
and replaced with the data that your program writes to the file.   This will be
done without any warning.  To avoid overwriting a file that already exists, you
can check whether a file of the same name already exists before trying to create
the stream, as discussed later in this section.  An
<span class="classname">IOException</span> might occur in the <span class="classname">PrintWriter</span>
constructor if, for example, you are trying to create a
file on a disk that is "write-protected," meaning that it cannot be modified.</p>


<p>When you are finished with a <span class="classname">PrintWriter</span>,
you should call its <span class="code">flush()</span> method, such as "<span class="code">result.flush()</span>",
to make sure that all the output has been sent to its destination.  If you forget to
do this, you might find that some of the data that you have written to a file
has not actually shown up in the file.</p>


<p>After you are finished using a file, it's a good idea to <span class="newword">close</span> 
the file, to tell the operating system that you are
finished using it.  You can close a file by calling the <span class="code">close()</span> method of the
associated <span class="classname">PrintWriter</span>, <span class="classname">BufferedReader</span>, or 
<span class="classname">Scanner</span>.  
Once a file has been closed, it is no longer possible to
read data from it or write data to it, unless you open it again as a new
I/O stream. (Note that for most I/O stream classes, including <span class="classname">BufferedReader</span>
 the <span class="code">close()</span> method can
throw an <span class="classname">IOException</span>, which must be handled; however, 
<span class="classname">PrintWriter</span> and <span class="classname">Scanner</span>
override this method so that it cannot throw such exceptions.)
If you forget to close a file, the file will ordinarily be
closed automatically when the program terminates or when the file object
is garbage collected, but it is better not to depend on this.  Note that
calling <span class="code">close()</span> should automatically call <span class="code">flush()</span>
before the file is closed. (I have seen that fail, but not recently.)</p>


<p>As a complete example, here is a program that will read numbers from a file
named <span class="code">data.dat</span>, and will then write out the same numbers in reverse
order to another file named <span class="code">result.dat</span>. It is assumed that
<span class="code">data.dat</span> contains only real numbers.
The input file is read using a <span class="classname">Scanner</span>.
Exception-handling is used to check for
problems along the way. Although the application is not a particularly useful
one, this program demonstrates the basics of working with files.</p>


<pre>import java.io.*;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Scanner;

/**
 * Reads numbers from a file named data.dat and writes them to a file
 * named result.dat in reverse order.  The input file should contain
 * only real numbers.
 */
public class ReverseFileWithScanner {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner data;        // For reading the data.
        PrintWriter result;  // Character output stream for writing data.

        ArrayList&lt;Double&gt; numbers;  // An ArrayList for holding the data.

        numbers = new ArrayList&lt;Double&gt;();

        try {  // Create the input stream.
            data = new Scanner(new File("data.dat"));
        }
        catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println("Can't find file data.dat!");
            return;  // End the program by returning from main().
        }

        try {  // Create the output stream.
            result = new PrintWriter("result.dat");
        }
        catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println("Can't open file result.dat!");
            System.out.println("Error: " + e);
            data.close();  // Close the input file.
            return;        // End the program.
        }

        while ( data.hasNextDouble() ) {  // Read until end-of-file.
            double inputNumber = data.nextDouble();
            numbers.add( inputNumber );
        }

        // Output the numbers in reverse order.

        for (int i = numbers.size()-1; i &gt;= 0; i--)
            result.println(numbers.get(i));

        System.out.println("Done!");

        data.close();
        result.close();

    }  // end of main()

} // end class ReverseFileWithScanner</pre>


<p>Note that this program will simply stop reading data from the file if it encounters anything other
than a number in the input.  That will not be considered to be an error.</p>
   

<hr class="break">


<p>As mentioned at the end of <a href="../c8/s3.html#robustness.3.2">Subsection&nbsp;8.3.2</a>, the pattern of creating or opening 
a "resource," using it, and then closing the resource is a very common one, and the pattern
is supported by the syntax of the <span class="code">try..catch</span> statement.  Files are resources
in this sense, as are <span class="classname">Scanner</span>, <span class="classname">PrintWriter</span>,
and all of Java's I/O streams.  All of these things define <span class="code">close()</span> methods,
and it is good form to close them when you are finished using them.  Since they all
implement the <span class="classname">AutoCloseable</span> interface, they are all resources
in the sense required by <span class="code">try..catch</span>.  A <span class="code">try..catch</span> statement
can be used to automatically close a resource when the <span class="code">try</span> statement ends,
which eliminates the need to close it by hand in a <span class="code">finally</span> clause.
This assumes that you will open the resource and use it in the same <span class="code">try..catch</span>.
</p>


<p>As an example, the sample program <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter11/ReverseFileWithResources.java">ReverseFileWithResources.java</a></span>
is another version of the example we have been looking at.  In this case, <span class="code">try..catch</span>
statements using the resource pattern are used to read the data from a file and to write
the data to a file.  My original program opened a file in one <span class="code">try</span> statement
and used it in another <span class="code">try</span> statement.  The resource pattern requires that it all
be done in one <span class="code">try</span>, which requires some reorganization of the code (and can sometimes
make it harder to determine the exact cause of an exception).  Here is the <span class="code">try..catch</span>
statement from the sample program that opens the input file, reads from it, and closes it automatically.
</p>


<pre>try( Scanner data = new Scanner(new File("data.dat")) ) {
        // Read numbers, adding them to the ArrayList.
    while ( data.hasNextDouble() ) {  // Read until end-of-file.
        double inputNumber = data.nextDouble();
        numbers.add( inputNumber );
    }
}
catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
        // Can be caused if file does not exist or can't be read.
    System.out.println("Can't open input file data.dat!");
    System.out.println("Error: " + e);
    return;  // Return from main(), since an error has occurred.
}</pre>


<p>The resource, <span class="code">data</span>, is constructed on the first line.  The syntax requires
a declaration of the resource with an initial value, in parentheses after the
word "try."  It's possible to have several resource declarations, separated by
semicolons.  They will be closed in the order opposite to the order in which they
are declared.</p>

<a name="IO.2.2">11.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Files and Directories</a>
</h3>



<p>The subject of file names is actually more complicated than I've let on so
far. To fully specify a file, you have to give both the name of the file and
the name of the directory where that file is located. A simple file name like
"data.dat" or "result.dat" is taken to refer to a file in a directory that is
called the <span class="newword">current directory</span> (also known as the "default
directory" or "working directory"). The current directory is not a permanent
thing. It can be changed by the user or by a program. Files not in the current
directory must be referred to by a <span class="newword">path name</span>,
which includes both the name of the file and information about the directory
where it can be found.</p>


<p>To complicate matters even further, there are two types of path names,
<span class="newword">absolute path names</span> and <span class="newword">relative path names</span>. 
An absolute path name uniquely identifies
one file among all the files available to the computer. It contains full
information about which directory the file is in and what the file's name is. A
relative path name tells the computer how to locate the file starting from the
current directory.</p>


<p>Unfortunately, the syntax for file names and path names varies somewhat
from one type of computer to another. Here are some examples:</p>


<ul>

<li>
<span class="code">data.dat</span> &mdash; on any computer, this would be a file named "data.dat"
in the current directory.</li>

<li>
<span class="code">/home/eck/java/examples/data.dat</span> &mdash; This is an absolute path name
in a UNIX operating system, including Linux and Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X. 
It refers to a file named data.dat in a directory
named examples, which is in turn in a directory named java,&nbsp;....</li>

<li>
<span class="code">C:\eck\java\examples\data.dat</span> &mdash; An absolute path name on a 
Windows computer.</li>

<li>
<span class="code">examples/data.dat</span> &mdash; a relative path name under UNIX; "examples"
is the name of a directory that is contained within the current directory, and
data.dat is a file in that directory. The corresponding relative path name
for Windows would be <span class="code">examples\data.dat</span>.</li>

<li>
<span class="code">../examples/data.dat</span> &mdash; a relative path name in UNIX that means "go to the
directory that contains the current directory, then go into a directory named examples
inside that directory, and look there for a file named data.dat."  In general, "<span class="code">..</span>"
means "go up one directory."  The corresponding path on Windows is
<span class="code">..\examples\data.dat</span>.</li>

</ul>


<p>When working on the command line, it's safe
to say that if you stick to using simple file names only, and if the
files are stored in the same directory with the program that will use them,
then you will be OK.   Later in this section, we'll look at a convenient way of
letting the user specify a file in a GUI program, which allows you to avoid the issue of
path names altogether.</p>
   

<p>It is possible for a Java program to find out the absolute path names
for two important directories, the current directory and the user's home
directory. The names of these directories are <span class="newword">system properties</span>,
and they can be read using the function calls:
</p>
   

<ul>

<li>
<span class="codedef">System.getProperty("user.dir")</span> &mdash; returns the
absolute path name of the current directory as a <span class="classname">String</span>.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">System.getProperty("user.home")</span> &mdash; returns the
absolute path name of the user's home directory as a <span class="classname">String</span>.</li>

</ul>


<p>To avoid some of the problems caused by differences in path names between platforms, Java
has the class <span class="code">java.io.File</span>. An object belonging to this class does not
actually represent a file!
Precisely speaking, an object of type <span class="classname">File</span> represents a
file <b>name</b> rather than a file as such. The file to which the name
refers might or might not exist. Directories are treated in the same way as
files, so a <span class="classname">File</span> object can represent a directory just as easily as it
can represent a file.</p>


<p>A <span class="classname">File</span> object has a constructor, "<span class="code">new&nbsp;</span><span class="code">File(String)</span>",
that creates a <span class="classname">File</span> object from a path name. The name can be a simple
name, a relative path, or an absolute path. For example, 
<span class="code">new</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">File("data.dat")</span> 
creates a <span class="classname">File</span> object that refers to a file
named data.dat, in the current directory. Another constructor, 
"<span class="code">new</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">File(File,String)</span>", has two parameters. 
The first is a <span class="classname">File</span>
object that refers to a directory. The second can be the
name of the file in that directory or a relative path from that directory to the file.</p>


<p>
<span class="classname">File</span> objects contain several useful instance methods. Assuming that
<span class="code">file</span> is a variable of type <span class="classname">File</span>, here are some of the methods
that are available:</p>


<ul>

<li>
<span class="codedef">file.exists()</span> &mdash; This
<span class="ptype">boolean</span>-valued function returns <span class="code">true</span> if the file named by the
<span class="classname">File</span> object already exists. You can use this method if you want to
avoid overwriting the contents of an existing file when you create a new
output stream. The <span class="ptype">boolean</span> function <span class="codedef">file.canRead()</span> returns
true if the file exists and the program has permission to read the file.  And
<span class="codedef">file.canWrite()</span> is true if the program has permission to write to the
file.</li>


<li>
<span class="codedef">file.isDirectory()</span> &mdash; This
<span class="ptype">boolean</span>-valued function returns <span class="code">true</span> if the <span class="classname">File</span>
object refers to a directory. It returns <span class="code">false</span> if it refers to a
regular file or if no file with the given name exists.</li>


<li>
<span class="codedef">file.delete()</span> &mdash; Deletes the file, if
it exists.  Returns a <span class="ptype">boolean</span> value to indicate whether
the file was successfully deleted.</li>


<li>
<span class="codedef">file.list()</span> &mdash; If the <span class="code">File</span>
object refers to a directory, this function returns an array of type
<span class="code">String[]</span> containing the names of the files in that directory.
Otherwise, it returns <span class="code">null</span>. The method <span class="codedef">file.listFiles()</span>
is similar, except that it returns an array of <span class="classname">File</span>
instead of an array of <span class="classname">String</span>.</li>

</ul>
   

<p>Here, for example, is a program that will list the names of all the files in
a directory specified by the user.  In this example, I have used a
<span class="classname">Scanner</span> to read the user's input:</p>


<pre>import java.io.File;
import java.util.Scanner;

/**
 * This program lists the files in a directory specified by
 * the user.  The user is asked to type in a directory name.
 * If the name entered by the user is not a directory, a
 * message is printed and the program ends.
 */
public class DirectoryList {

   
   public static void main(String[] args) {
   
      String directoryName;  // Directory name entered by the user.
      File directory;        // File object referring to the directory.
      String[] files;        // Array of file names in the directory.
      Scanner scanner;       // For reading a line of input from the user.

      scanner = new Scanner(System.in);  // scanner reads from standard input.

      System.out.print("Enter a directory name: ");
      directoryName = scanner.nextLine().trim();
      directory = new File(directoryName);
      
      if (directory.isDirectory() == false) {
          if (directory.exists() == false)
             System.out.println("There is no such directory!");
          else
             System.out.println("That file is not a directory.");
      }
      else {
          files = directory.list();
          System.out.println("Files in directory \"" + directory + "\":");
          for (int i = 0; i &lt; files.length; i++)
             System.out.println("   " + files[i]);
      }
   
   } // end main()

} // end class DirectoryList</pre>


<p>All the classes that are used for reading data from files and writing data
to files have constructors that take a <span class="classname">File</span> object as a parameter. For
example, if <span class="code">file</span> is a variable of type <span class="classname">File</span>, and you want to
read character data from that file, you can create a <span class="classname">FileReader</span> to do
so by saying <span class="code">new</span>&nbsp;<span class="code">FileReader(file)</span>.</p>




   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="IO.2.3">11.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;File Dialog Boxes</a>
</h3>
   


<p>In many programs, you want the user to be able to select the file that is
going to be used for input or output. If your program lets the user type in the
file name, you will just have to assume that the user understands how to work
with files and directories. But in a graphical user interface, the user expects
to be able to select files using a <span class="newword">file dialog box</span>, 
which is a window that a program can open when it wants the
user to select a file for input or output. JavaFX includes a
platform-independent technique for using file dialog boxes in the form of a
class called <span class="classname">FileChooser</span>, in package <span class="code">javafx.stage</span>.</p>


<p>A file dialog box shows the user a list of files and sub-directories in some
directory, and makes it easy for the user to specify a file in that directory.
The user can also navigate easily from one directory to another. The 
common constructor for <span class="classname">FileChooser</span> has no parameter.
Constructing a <span class="classname">FileChooser</span> object does not make the dialog box
appear on the screen. You have to call a method in the object to do that.
Often, before showing the dialog box, you will call instance methods in the <span class="classname">FileChooser</span>
object to set some properties of the dialog box.  For example, you can set the
file name that is shown to the user as a default initial value for the file.</p>


<p>A file dialog box can have an "owner," which is a window, which in JavaFX
means an object of type <span class="classname">Stage</span>. Until the dialog
box is dismissed by the user&mdash;either by canceling the dialog or selecting
a file&mdash;all interaction with the owner window is blocked.  The owner
can be specified as a parameter to the method that opens the dialog.
The owner can be <span class="code">null</span>, which will mean that no window is
blocked.</p>


<p>There are two types of
file dialog: an <span class="newword">open file dialog</span> that allows the user
to specify an existing file to be opened for reading data into the program; and a
<span class="newword">save file dialog</span> lets the user specify a file,
which might or might not already exist, to be opened for output.
A <span class="classname">FileChooser</span> has two instance methods for 
showing the two kinds of dialog box on the screen.  Suppose that
<span class="code">fileDialog</span> is a variable of type <span class="classname">FileChooser</span>.
Then the following methods are available:</p>


<ul>

<li>
<span class="codedef">fileDialog.showOpenDialog(window)</span> &mdash; shows an open
file dialog box on the screen.  The parameter specifies the owner of the
dialog box.  This method does not return until the user has selected a
file or canceled the dialog without selecting a file.  The method returns
a value of type <span class="classname">File</span>.  The return value is
<span class="code">null</span> if the user canceled the dialog box.  Otherwise, it returns
a <span class="classname">File</span> object representing the selected file.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">fileDialog.showSaveDialog(window)</span> &mdash; shows a
save file dialog box, with owner equal to <span class="code">window</span>.  The 
parameter and return value are the same as for <span class="code">showOpenDialog()</span>.
If the user selects a file that already exists, the system will automatically
ask whether the user wants to replace that file.  So, you can safely go
ahead and save the specified file.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">fileDialog.setTitle(title)</span> &mdash; specifies a title to appear
in the title bar of the dialog box.  The parameter is a string.  This method
must be called before showing the dialog box.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">fileDialog.setInitialFileName(name)</span> &mdash; sets the name
that appears as a default name in the input box for the file name.  The parameter
is a string. If the parameter is null, the input box will be empty; that is also the
default.  This method
must be called before showing the dialog box.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">fileDialog.setInitialDirectory(directory)</span> &mdash; sets the directory
that is shown in the dialog box when it first appears.  The parameter is of type
<span class="classname">File</span>.  If the parameter is <span class="code">null</span>, the initial directory
will be a system-dependent default (possibly the directory from which the program was run).
If the parameter is not <span class="code">null</span>, it must be a <span class="classname">File</span> object
that represents a directory, not a regular file, or an error will occur.
This method must be called before showing the dialog box.</li>

</ul>


<p>A typical program has "Save" and "Open" commands for working with files.  When the
user selects a file for saving or opening, it can be a good idea to store the
selected <span class="classname">File</span> object in an instance variable.  Later, 
that file can be used to initialize the directory and possibly the file name
the next time a file dialog box is created.  If <span class="code">editFile</span> is
the instance variable that records the selected file, and if it is 
non-null, then <span class="code">editFile.getName()</span> is a <span class="classname">String</span>
giving the name of the file, and <span class="code">editFile.getParent()</span> is
a <span class="classname">File</span> representing the directory that contains the
file.</p>


<p>This leaves open one question: what to do when an error occurs while
reading or writing the selected file?  The error should be caught, and
the user should be informed that an error occurred.  In a GUI program,
the natural way to do that is with another dialog box that shows an
error message to the user and has an "OK" button for dismissing
the dialog.  Dialog boxes were not covered in <a href="../c6/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>,
but some common simple dialog boxes can be shown using objects of type
<span class="classname">Alert</span>, from package <span class="code">javafx.scene.control</span>.
(See <a href="../c13/s4.html#GUI2.4.1">Subsection&nbsp;13.4.1</a> for more about alerts.)
Here is how to show an error message to the user:</p>


<pre>Alert errorAlert = new Alert( Alert.AlertType.ERROR, message );
errorAlert.showAndWait();</pre>


<p>Putting all this together, we can look at a typical subroutine that saves
data to a file. The file is selected using a <span class="classname">FileChooser</span>.
In this example, the data is written in text form, using a
<span class="classname">PrintWriter</span>:</p>


<pre>private void doSave() {
    FileChooser fileDialog = new FileChooser(); 
    if (editFile == null) {
           // No file is being edited.  Set file name to "filename.txt"
           // and set the directory to the user's home directory.
        fileDialog.setInitialFileName("filename.txt");
        fileDialog.setInitialDirectory( 
                new File( System.getProperty("user.home")) );
    }
    else {
           // Get the file name and directory for the dialog from
           //       the file that is currently being edited.
        fileDialog.setInitialFileName(editFile.getName());
        fileDialog.setInitialDirectory(editFile.getParentFile());
    }
    fileDialog.setTitle("Select File to be Saved");
    File selectedFile = fileDialog.showSaveDialog(mainWindow);
    if ( selectedFile == null )
        return;  // User did not select a file.
    // Note: User has selected a file AND, if the file exists, has
    //    confirmed that it is OK to erase the exiting file.
    PrintWriter out; 
    try {
        FileWriter stream = new FileWriter(selectedFile); 
        out = new PrintWriter( stream );
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
           // Most likely, user doesn't have permission to write the file.
        Alert errorAlert = new Alert(Alert.AlertType.ERROR,
                "Sorry, but an error occurred while\n" +
                trying to open the file for output.");
        errorAlert.showAndWait();
        return;
    }
    try {
           .
           .   // WRITE TEXT TO THE FILE, using the PrintWriter
           .
        out.flush(); // (not needed?; it's probably done by out.close();
        out.close();
        if (out.checkError())   // (need to check for errors in PrintWriter)
            throw new IOException("Error check failed.");
        editFile = selectedFile;
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
        Alert errorAlert = new Alert(Alert.AlertType.ERROR,
                "Sorry, but an error occurred while\n" +
                "trying to write data to the file.");
        errorAlert.showAndWait();
    }    
}</pre>


<p>This general outline can easily be adapted to non-text files by using 
a different type of output stream.</p>


<p>Reading data from a file is similar, and I won't show the corresponding
<span class="code">doOpen()</span> method here.  You can find working subroutines
for saving and opening text files in the sample program
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter11/TrivialEdit.java">TrivialEdit.java</a></span>, which lets the user edit small
text files.  The file subroutines in that program can be adapted to
many GUI programs that work with files.</p>
