<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 11.1:</h3>
<p>The sample program <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter11/DirectoryList.java">DirectoryList.java</a></span>,
given as an example in <a href="../c11/s2.html#IO.2.2">Subsection&nbsp;11.2.2</a>, will print a list of files in a directory
specified by the user. But some of the files in that directory might themselves
be directories. And the subdirectories can themselves contain directories. And
so on. Write a modified version of <span class="code">DirectoryList</span> that will list all
the files in a directory and all its subdirectories, to any level of nesting.
You will need a <b>recursive</b> subroutine to do the listing. The subroutine should
have a parameter of type <span class="classname">File</span>. You will need the constructor from the
<span class="classname">File</span> class that has the form</p>

<pre>public File( File dir, String fileName )
   // Constructs the File object representing a file
   // named fileName in the directory specified by dir.</pre>

<p>One possible recursive algorithm for printing all the files in a directory
and its subdirectories is:</p>


<pre>Print the name of the directory
for each file in the directory:
   if the file is a directory:
      Print its contents recursively
   else
      Print the name of the file.</pre>


<p>If the directory is given as an object of type <span class="classname">File</span>, then this can
be coded easily. We need some instance methods from the <span class="classname">File</span> class.
(This subroutine is not quite what I ended up using in my solution.)</p>


<pre>static void listDirectoryContents( File dir ) {
    System.out.println("Directory \"" + dir.getName() + "\"");  
    String[] files;  // The names of the files in the directory.
    files = dir.list();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; files.length; i++) {
        File f;  // One of the files in the directory.
        f = new File(dir, files[i]);
        if ( f.isDirectory() ) {
               // Call listDirectoryContents() recursively to
               // list the contents of the directory, f.
            listDirectoryContents(f);
        }
        else {
              // For a regular file, just print the name, files[i].
            System.out.println(files[i]);
        }
    }
} // end listDirectoryContents()</pre>


<p>Every time this routine finds a directory, it lists not just the name of the
directory but also, recursively, the names of everything that it contains. The
only problem with this is that it doesn't indicate which items are in which
directory. For example, consider the output:</p>


<pre>Directory "games"
blackbox
Directory "CardGames"
cribbage
euchre
tetris</pre>


<p>There is no way to tell where the list of items in "CardGames" ends.
Possibly, for example, "euchre" is in the "CardGames" directory. But possibly,
"cribbage" is the only file in "CardGames" and "euchre" is actually part of the
listing for "games". It would be nice to use indentation to show the nesting,
like this:</p>


<pre>Directory "games"
   blackbox
   Directory "CardGames"
      cribbage
      euchre
   tetris</pre>


<p>In this listing, you can tell that "euchre" is in fact in "CardGames"
while "tetris" is in "games". To implement this, we just have to recognize that
the indentation can be different in each call to the <span class="code">listDirectoryContents()</span>
method. Since it can be different, it should be a parameter. When we call
<span class="code">listDirectoryContents()</span> recursively, we should increase the indentation. You
can see how this is done in the actual solution, given below.</p>
