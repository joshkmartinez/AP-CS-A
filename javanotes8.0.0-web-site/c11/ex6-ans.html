<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 11.6:</h3>
<p>The sample program <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter7/Checkers.java">Checkers.java</a></span> from
<a href="../c7/s5.html#arrays.5.3">Subsection&nbsp;7.5.3</a> lets two players play checkers.  It would be nice if, in the
middle of a game, the state of the game could be saved to a file.  Later, the file
could be read back into the file to restore the game and allow the players to
continue.  Add the ability to save and load files to the checkers program.
Design a simple text-based format for the files.  Here is a picture of my
solution to this exercise, showing that Load and Save buttons have been added:</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="CheckersWithFiles.png" width="400" height="336" alt="Checkers program window."></p>

<p>It's a little tricky to completely restore the state of a game.  The program
has a variable <span class="code">board</span> of type <span class="classname">CheckersData</span> that
stores the current contents of the board, and it has a variable <span class="code">currentPlayer</span>
of type <span class="ptype">int</span> that indicates whether Red or Black is currently moving.
This data must be stored in the file when a file is saved.  When a file is read
into the program, you should read the data into two local variables
<span class="code">newBoard</span> of type <span class="classname">CheckersData</span> and
<span class="code">newCurrentPlayer</span> of type <span class="ptype">int</span>.  Once you have
successfully read all the data from the file, you can use the following
code to set up the program state correctly.  This code assumes that you
have introduced two new variables <span class="code">saveButton</span> and <span class="code">loadButton</span>
of type <span class="classname">Button</span> to represent the "Save Game" and "Load Game" buttons:</p>

<pre>board = newBoard;  // Set up game with data read from file.
currentPlayer = newCurrentPlayer;
legalMoves = board.getLegalMoves(currentPlayer);
selectedRow = -1;
gameInProgress = true;
newGameButton.setDisable(true);
loadButton.setDisable(true);
saveButton.setDisable(false);
resignButton.setDisable(false);
if (currentPlayer == CheckersData.RED)
   message.setText("Game loaded -- it's RED's move.");
else
   message.setText("Game loaded -- it's BLACK's move.");
drawBoard();</pre>

<div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr>
<p>Many different formats could be used to represent the data
for a checkers game in text form.  In the program, the board data is an 8-by-8
two-dimensional array of integers.  One way to represent the board would be
to simply output 64 integers.  However, the possible values in the array are
given by constants <span class="code">CheckersData.RED</span>, <span class="code">CheckersData.BLACK</span>, 
<span class="code">CheckersData.RED_KING</span>, <span class="code">CheckersData.BLACK_KING</span>, and
<span class="code">CheckersData.EMPTY</span>, and it would be nice to use a representation
that uses the <b>meaning</b> of these constants.  I decided to represent the
possible values with individual characters.  An empty square is represented
by&nbsp;'.'; a regular red piece by 'r'; a regular black piece by 'b';
a red king by 'R'; and a black king by 'B'.  The contents of the 8-by-8 board
are then represented by 8 lines with 8 characters on each line, separated by 
spaces.  The spaces are there so that the characters can be read back
individually from the file using a <span class="classname">Scanner</span>.  I added
a line at the beginning containing the name of the program "CheckersWithFiles";
this makes it easy to check that a file that the user selects for input is
of the correct type. The last line of the file contains the string "Red" if it
is Red's turn to move or "Black" if it is Black's turn.  Here is a sample
file created by my program:</p>

<pre>CheckersWithFiles
b . b . . . b . 
. . . . . b . b 
. . . . b . . . 
. . . . . . . . 
. . b . . . r . 
. . . b . r . . 
r . . . . . . . 
. r . B . r . r 
Red</pre>
   

<p>I wrote methods <span class="code">doSave()</span> and <span class="code">doLoad()</span> to
save and load files.  They are modeled directly on the sample
save and open methods that were presented in this chapter. The <span class="code">doSave()</span>
method uses a <span class="classname">PrintWriter</span> to write the
file.  The data is taken from the variables <span class="code">board</span>
and <span class="code">currentPlayer</span>, as described in the exercise.  This
is very straightforward:</p>

<pre>out.println("CheckersWithFiles"); // Identifies file as a Checkers game.
for (int row = 0; row &lt; 8; row++) {
   for (int col = 0; col &lt; 8; col++) {
      int piece = board.pieceAt(row, col);  // Contents of one square of board.
      switch (piece) {
         case CheckersData.EMPTY:      out.print(". ");  break;
         case CheckersData.RED:        out.print("r ");  break;
         case CheckersData.BLACK:      out.print("b ");  break;
         case CheckersData.RED_KING:   out.print("R ");  break;
         case CheckersData.BLACK_KING: out.print("B ");  break;
      }
   }
   out.println();
}
out.println(currentPlayer == CheckersData.RED ? "Red" : "Black");
out.flush();
out.close();
if (out.checkError())
   throw new IOException("Some error occurred while saving the file.");</pre>


<p>Reading the data back in is not much harder.  
I used a <span class="classname">Scanner</span> named <span class="code">in</span>
to read the data from the file.  The method <span class="code">in.nextLine()</span> can
be used to read the first line of text; <span class="code">in.next()</span> is used
to read the character that represent the pieces on the board, as strings; 
and <span class="code">in.next()</span> is also used to read the last word in the
file, which will be "Red" or "Black".  Remember that <span class="code">in.next()</span>
will skip over any spaces and end-of-lines before
returning a non-blank token string; this makes it very easy to read the
data format that I chose for the file.  Here is the section of
my <span class="code">doLoad()</span> method that reads the data. It has
a little more error-checking than you might have used in your
own solution:</p>


<pre>Scanner in;
try {
    in = new Scanner(selectedFile);
}
catch (Exception e) {
    Alert errorAlert = new Alert(Alert.AlertType.ERROR,
            "Sorry, but an error occurred while\n" + 
                    "trying to open the file:\n" + e);
    errorAlert.showAndWait();
    return;
}
if (selectedFile == null)
    return;  // user canceled
try {
    CheckersData newBoard = new CheckersData();
    int newCurrentPlayer;
    String programNameFromFile = in.nextLine();
    if (! programNameFromFile.equals("CheckersWithFiles"))
        throw new Exception("Selected file does not contain a checkers game.");
    for (int row = 0; row &lt; 8; row++) {
        for (int col = 0; col &lt; 8; col++) {
            String pieceCode = in.next();
            switch (pieceCode) {
            case ".": newBoard.setPieceAt(row, col, CheckersData.EMPTY); break;
            case "r": newBoard.setPieceAt(row, col, CheckersData.RED); break;
            case "b": newBoard.setPieceAt(row, col, CheckersData.BLACK); break;
            case "R": newBoard.setPieceAt(row, col, CheckersData.RED_KING); break;
            case "B": newBoard.setPieceAt(row, col, CheckersData.BLACK_KING); break;
            default: throw new Exception("Illegal board data found in file.");
            }
            if (row % 2 != col % 2 &amp;&amp;
                    newBoard.pieceAt(row, col) != CheckersData.EMPTY)
                throw new Exception("Illegal board data found in file.");
        }
        in.nextLine();  // Discard rest of line -- not really necessary.
    }
    String currentPlayerString = in.next();
    in.close(); // Done reading data from the file.
    if (currentPlayerString.equals("Red"))
        newCurrentPlayer = CheckersData.RED;
    else if (currentPlayerString.equals("Black"))
        newCurrentPlayer = CheckersData.BLACK;
    else
        throw new Exception("Illegal current player found in file.");
    board = newBoard;  // Set up game with data read from file.
    currentPlayer = newCurrentPlayer;
    legalMoves = board.getLegalMoves(currentPlayer);
    selectedRow = -1;
    gameInProgress = true;
    newGameButton.setDisable(true);
    loadButton.setDisable(true);
    saveButton.setDisable(false);
    resignButton.setDisable(false);
    if (currentPlayer == CheckersData.RED)
        message.setText("Game loaded -- it's RED's move.");
    else
        message.setText("Game loaded -- it's BLACK's move.");
    drawBoard();</pre>
    

<p>Note that after successfully reading data from the file, this method uses
the code given in the exercise for restoring the state of the program to match
the state of the game that has been read from the file.</p>
   

<p>Aside from writing the <span class="code">doSave()</span> and <span class="code">doLoad</span> methods,
you must also add "Save Game" and "Load Game" buttons to the program, and
you have to decide when they should be enabled and disabled. In my program, the
user can save a game only when a game is actually in progress.  The "Save"
button is enabled as soon as a move is made in a game (<span class="code">saveButton.setDisable(false)</span>
is actually called every time a move is made, but only the first call matters).
The "Save" button is disabled in the <span class="code">gameOver()</span> method, which
is always called when a game ends.  As for the "Load" button, it is disabled
when a game is in progress, and is enabled when a game ends.
You can see all of the changes that I made in the  solution below.</p>
