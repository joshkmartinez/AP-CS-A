<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 11.2:</h3>
<p>Write a program that will
count the number of lines in each file that is specified on the command line.
Assume that the files are text files. Note that multiple files can be
specified, as in:</p>

<pre>java  LineCounts  file1.txt  file2.txt  file3.txt</pre>

<p>Write each file name, along with the number of lines in that file, to standard
output. If an error occurs while trying to read from one of the files, you
should print an error message for that file, but you should still process all
the remaining files. Do not use
<span class="classname">TextIO</span> to process the files; use a <span class="classname">Scanner</span> or a
<span class="classname">BufferedReader</span> to process each file.</p>

<p>The <span class="code">main()</span> routine for this program is a simple for loop that
processes the command-line arguments. Each argument is supposed to be the name
of a file. The loop just prints the file name and calls a subroutine that
counts the number of lines in the file and outputs the result:</p>


<pre>for (int i = 0; i &lt; args.length; i++) {
   System.out.print(args[i] + ": ");
   countLines(args[i]);
}</pre>


<p>The <span class="code">countLines()</span> subroutine will catch any errors that occur when
it tries to access the file. If an error occurs, it will output an error
message instead of the number of lines. Since the error is handled in the
subroutine, it won't crash the program or stop the <span class="code">main()</span> routine from
going on to process any remaining files.</p>


<p>The <span class="code">countLines()</span> subroutine can be written using either a
a <span class="classname">BufferedReader</span>
or a <span class="classname">Scanner</span> to read lines from the file; each of these
classes has a simple method for reading a complete line of text from the file.
(An alternative approach would read individual characters from the file and
count the number of end-of-line markers.  Unfortunately, ends-of-line can be
marked by any of the strings "\n", "\r", or "\r\n" and that would add to the
difficulty of the task.  The line reading methods in 
<span class="classname">BufferedReader</span> and <span class="classname">Scanner</span> will
work no matter which end-of-line marker is used.)</p>

<p>In my solution, I use a <span class="classname">BufferedReader</span>.
The <span class="code">countLines()</span> method creates a <span class="classname">BufferedReader</span> stream to
read from the file. It then calls the <span class="code">readLine()</span> routine from the
<span class="classname">BufferedReader</span> class to read lines of text from the file, until the end of
the file is encountered.  For a <span class="classname">BufferedReader</span>, the
end-of-file can be recognized when <span class="code">readLine()</span> returns <span class="code">null</span>.  
The method counts each line as it reads it. In the end, the
value of the counter is the number of lines in the file. The subroutine writes
this value to standard output. All this is done in a <span class="code">try..catch</span>
statement, treating the <span class="classname">BufferedReader</span> as a resource,
so that an error can be handled if it occurs. It's pretty
straightforward. The complete solution is given below.</p>


<p>An interesting variation on this would be to use the stream API from
<a href="../c10/s6.html">Section&nbsp;10.6</a>.  A <span class="classname">BufferedReader</span>,
<span class="code">in</span>, has a method <span class="code">in.lines()</span> that creates
a stream of strings containing the lines of the file.  We can find out
how many lines there are just by applying the <span class="code">count()</span> stream
operation to that stream.  So, using the stream API, the lines could
be counted using</p>
  

<pre>long lineCt = in.lines().count();</pre>
   

<p>One note about the command line for calling this program. If you are
using UNIX, including Mac OS or Linux, you can take advantage of something called "wildcards" in
the command-line arguments. For example, if you say, "<span class="code">java LineCounts *.txt</span>",
the "*" is a wildcard. The operating system will expand "*.txt" into a list of
all the files in the current directory that end in ".txt". Similarly, "*xx*"
expands into a list of all file names that contain "xx", and "fil*dat" expands
into the list of file names that begin with "fil" and end with "dat". The "*"
matches any number of characters in the file name, including zero characters.
This expansion is done before your program sees the command-line arguments, so
you don't have to worry about it in your program.
Typing the command "<span class="code">java LineCounts *.txt</span>" would be exactly equivalent
to typing something like "<span class="code">java LineCounts file1.txt file2.txt
file3.txt</span>". This type of expansion happens for any command in UNIX, not
just for the "java" command.</p>
