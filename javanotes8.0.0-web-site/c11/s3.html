<hr class="break">
   

<p>
<span class="start"><big>I</big>n this section</span>, we look at several programming
examples that work with files, using the techniques that were
introduced in <a href="../c11/s1.html">Section&nbsp;11.1</a> and <a href="../c11/s2.html">Section&nbsp;11.2</a>.</p>


<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="IO.3.1">11.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Copying a File</a>
</h3>
   

<p>As a first example, we look at a simple command-line program
that can make a copy of a file.
Copying a file is a pretty common operation, and every operating
system already has a command for doing it. However, it is still instructive
to look at a Java program that does the same thing. Many file operations are
similar to copying a file, except that the data from the input file is
processed in some way before it is written to the output file. All such
operations can be done by programs with the same general form.
<a href="../c4/s3.html#subroutines.3.4b">Subsection&nbsp;4.3.6</a> included a program for copying text files 
using <span class="classname">TextIO</span>.  The example in this section will
work for any file.</p>


<p>Since the program should be able to copy any file, we can't assume that the
data in the file is in human-readable form. So, we have to use the byte streams,
<span class="classname">InputStream</span> and <span class="classname">OutputStream</span>,
to operate on the file.  The program simply copies all the
data from the <span class="classname">InputStream</span> to the <span class="classname">OutputStream</span>, one byte at a
time. If <span class="code">source</span> is the variable that refers to the
<span class="classname">InputStream</span>, then the function <span class="code">source.read()</span> can be used to
read one byte. This function returns the value -1 when all the bytes in the
input file have been read. Similarly, if <span class="code">copy</span> refers to the
<span class="classname">OutputStream</span>, then <span class="code">copy.write(b)</span> writes one byte to the
output file. So, the heart of the program is a simple <span class="code">while</span> loop. As
usual, the I/O operations can throw exceptions, so this must be done in a
<span class="code">try..catch</span> statement:</p>


<pre>while(true) {
   int data = source.read();
   if (data &lt; 0)
      break;
   copy.write(data);
}</pre>


<p>The file-copy command in an operating system such as UNIX uses
command line arguments to specify the names of the files. For example, the user
might say "<span class="code">copy original.dat backup.dat</span>" to copy an existing file,
<span class="code">original.dat</span>, to a file named <span class="code">backup.dat</span>. Command-line
arguments can also be used in Java programs. The command line arguments are
stored in the array of strings, <span class="code">args</span>, which is a parameter to the
<span class="code">main()</span> routine. The program can retrieve the command-line arguments
from this array. (See <a href="../c4/s3.html#subroutines.3.4b">Subsection&nbsp;4.3.6</a>.)
For example, if the program is named <span class="code">CopyFile</span> and if
the user runs the program with the command</p>


<pre>java CopyFile work.dat oldwork.dat</pre>


<p>then in the program, <span class="code">args[0]</span> will be the string
<span class="code">"work.dat"</span> and <span class="code">args[1]</span> will be the string
<span class="code">"oldwork.dat"</span>. The value of <span class="code">args.length</span> tells the program how
many command-line arguments were specified by the user.</p>


<p>The program <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter11/CopyFile.java">CopyFile.java</a></span> gets the names of the files from the
command-line arguments. It prints an error message and exits if the file names
are not specified. To add a little interest, there are two ways to use the
program. The command line can simply specify the two file names. In that case,
if the output file already exists, the program will print an error message and
end. This is to make sure that the user won't accidently overwrite an important
file. However, if the command line has three arguments, then the first argument
must be "<span class="code">-f</span>" while the second and third arguments are file names. The
<span class="code">-f</span> is a <span class="newword">command-line option</span>, which is
meant to modify the behavior of the program. The program interprets the
<span class="code">-f</span> to mean that it's OK to overwrite an existing program. (The "f"
stands for "force," since it forces the file to be copied in spite of what
would otherwise have been considered an error.) You can see in the source code
how the command line arguments are interpreted by the program:</p>


<pre>import java.io.*;

/**
 *  Makes a copy of a file.  The original file and the name of the
 *  copy must be given as command-line arguments.  In addition, the
 *  first command-line argument can be "-f"; if present, the program
 *  will overwrite an existing file; if not, the program will report
 *  an error and end if the output file already exists.  The number
 *  of bytes that are copied is reported.
 */
public class CopyFile {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      
      String sourceName;   // Name of the source file, 
                           //    as specified on the command line.
      String copyName;     // Name of the copy, 
                           //    as specified on the command line.
      InputStream source;  // Stream for reading from the source file.
      OutputStream copy;   // Stream for writing the copy.
      boolean force;  // This is set to true if the "-f" option
                      //    is specified on the command line.
      int byteCount;  // Number of bytes copied from the source file.
      
      /* Get file names from the command line and check for the 
         presence of the -f option.  If the command line is not one
         of the two possible legal forms, print an error message and 
         end this program. */
   
      if (args.length == 3 &amp;&amp; args[0].equalsIgnoreCase("-f")) {
         sourceName = args[1];
         copyName = args[2];
         force = true;
      }
      else if (args.length == 2) {
         sourceName = args[0];
         copyName = args[1];
         force = false;
      }
      else {
         System.out.println(
                 "Usage:  java CopyFile &lt;source-file&gt; &lt;copy-name&gt;");
         System.out.println(
                 "    or  java CopyFile -f &lt;source-file&gt; &lt;copy-name&gt;");
         return;
      }
      
      /* Create the input stream.  If an error occurs, end the program. */
      
      try {
         source = new FileInputStream(sourceName);
      }
      catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
         System.out.println("Can't find file \"" + sourceName + "\".");
         return;
      }

         specified, print an error message and end the program. */
   
      File file = new File(copyName);
      if (file.exists() &amp;&amp; force == false) {
          System.out.println(
               "Output file exists.  Use the -f option to replace it.");

      /* Copy one byte at a time from the input stream to the output

         the signal that the end of the stream has been reached).  If any 
         error occurs, print an error message.  Also print a message if 
         the file has been copied successfully.  */
      
      byteCount = 0;
      
      try {
         while (true) {
            int data = source.read();
            if (data &lt; 0)
               break;
            copy.write(data);
            byteCount++;
         }
         source.close();
         copy.close();
         System.out.println("Successfully copied " + byteCount + " bytes.");
      }
      catch (Exception e) {
         System.out.println("Error occurred while copying.  "
                                   + byteCount + " bytes copied.");
         System.out.println("Error: " + e);
      }
      
   }  // end main()
   
   
} // end class CopyFile</pre>


<p>It is actually quite inefficient to copy one byte at a time.  Efficiency could
be improved by using alternative versions of the <span class="code">read()</span> and
<span class="code">write()</span> methods that read and write multiple bytes (see the
API for details).  Alternatively, the input and output streams could
be wrapped in objects of type <span class="classname">BufferedInputStream</span>
and <span class="classname">BufferedOutputStream</span> which automatically read
data from and write data to files in larger blocks.  This would require changing only
the two lines in the program that create the streams.  For example, the
input stream could be created using</p>


<pre>source = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(sourceName));</pre>


<p>The buffered stream would then be used in exactly the same way as the
unbuffered stream.</p>


<p>There is also a sample program <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter11/CopyFileAsResources.java">CopyFileAsResources.java</a></span> that
does the same thing as <span class="code">CopyFile</span> but uses the resource pattern in a 
<span class="code">try..catch</span> statement to make sure that the streams are closed in
all cases.  See the discussion at the end of <a href="../c8/s3.html#robustness.3.2">Subsection&nbsp;8.3.2</a>)</p>


   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="IO.3.2">11.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Persistent Data</a>
</h3>
   

<p>Once a program ends, any data that was stored in variables and objects in
the program is gone.  In many cases, it would be useful to have some of that
data stick around so that it will be available when the program is run again.
The problem is, how to make the data <span class="newword">persistent</span> between
runs of the program?  The answer, of course, is to store the data in a file
(or, for some applications, in a database&mdash;but the data in a
database is itself stored in files).</p>
   

<p>Consider a "phone book" program that allows the user to keep track of
a list of names and associated phone numbers.  The program would make no sense
at all if the user had to create the whole list from scratch each time
the program is run.  It would make more sense to think of the phone book
as a persistent collection of data, and to think of the program as an
interface to that collection of data.  The program would allow the user
to look up names in the phone book and to add new entries.  Any changes
that are made should be preserved after the program ends.</p>
   

<p>The sample program <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter11/PhoneDirectoryFileDemo.java">PhoneDirectoryFileDemo.java</a></span> is
a very simple implementation of this idea.  It is meant only as an
example of file use; the phone book that it implements is a "toy" version
that is <b>not</b> meant to be taken seriously.  This program stores the phone
book data in a file named "<span class="code">.phone_book_demo</span>" in the user's
home directory.  To find the user's home directory, it uses the
<span class="code">System.getProperty()</span> method that was mentioned in
<a href="../c11/s2.html#IO.2.2">Subsection&nbsp;11.2.2</a>.  When the program starts, it checks whether
the file already exists.  If it does, it should contain the user's
phone book, which was saved in a previous run of the program; in that case,
the data from the file is read and entered into a <span class="classname">TreeMap</span>
named <span class="code">phoneBook</span>
that represents the phone book while the program is running.
(See <a href="../c10/s3.html#generics.3.1">Subsection&nbsp;10.3.1</a>.)
In order to store the phone book in a file, some decision must be
made about how the data in the phone book will be represented. For
this example, I chose a simple representation in which each line of
the file contains one entry consisting of a name and the associated
phone number.  A percent sign (<span class="code">'%'</span>) separates the name 
from the number.  The following code at the beginning of the program
will read the phone book data file, if it exists and has the correct
format:</p>
   

<pre>File userHomeDirectory = new File( System.getProperty("user.home") );
File dataFile = new File( userHomeDirectory, ".phone_book_data" );
        // A file named .phone_book_data in the user's home directory.

if ( ! dataFile.exists() ) {
   System.out.println("No phone book data file found.  A new one");
   System.out.println("will be created, if you add any entries.");
   System.out.println("File name:  " + dataFile.getAbsolutePath());
}
else {
   System.out.println("Reading phone book data...");
   try( Scanner scanner = new Scanner(dataFile) ) {
      while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {
             // Read one line from the file, containing one name/number pair.
         String phoneEntry = scanner.nextLine();
         int separatorPosition = phoneEntry.indexOf('%');
         if (separatorPosition == -1)
            throw new IOException("File is not a phonebook data file.");
         name = phoneEntry.substring(0, separatorPosition);
         number = phoneEntry.substring(separatorPosition+1);
         phoneBook.put(name,number);
      }
   }
   catch (IOException e) {
      System.out.println("Error in phone book data file.");
      System.out.println("File name:  " + dataFile.getAbsolutePath());
      System.out.println("This program cannot continue.");
      System.exit(1);
   }
}</pre>
 

<p>The program then lets the user do various things with the phone book,
including making modifications.  Any changes that are made are made
only to the <span class="classname">TreeMap</span> that holds the data.
When the program ends, the phone book data is written to the file
(if any changes have been made while the program was running),
using the following code:</p>
     

<pre>if (changed) {
   System.out.println("Saving phone directory changes to file " + 
         dataFile.getAbsolutePath() + " ...");
   PrintWriter out;
   try {
      out = new PrintWriter( new FileWriter(dataFile) );
   }
   catch (IOException e) {
      System.out.println("ERROR: Can't open data file for output.");
      return;
   }
   for ( Map.Entry&lt;String,String&gt; entry : phoneBook.entrySet() )
      out.println(entry.getKey() + "%" + entry.getValue() );
   out.flush();
   out.close();
   if (out.checkError())
      System.out.println("ERROR: Some error occurred while writing data file.");
   else
      System.out.println("Done.");
}</pre>


<p>The net effect of this is that all the data, including the changes,
will be there the next time the program is run.  I've shown you all the
file-handling code from the program.  If you would like to see the rest
of the program, see the <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter11/PhoneDirectoryFileDemo.java">source code</a></span>.</p>
   



<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="IO.3.4">11.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Storing Objects in Files</a>
</h3>


<p>Whenever data is stored in files, some definite format must be adopted for
representing the data.  As long as the output routine that writes the data
and the input routine that reads the data use the same format, the files
will be usable.  However, as usual, correctness is not the end of the story.
The representation that is used for data in files should also be robust.
(See <a href="../c8/s1.html">Section&nbsp;8.1</a>.)  To see what this means, we will look
at several different ways of representing the same data.  This example
builds on the example <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter7/SimplePaint2.java">SimplePaint2.java</a></span> from
<a href="../c7/s3.html#arrays.3.3">Subsection&nbsp;7.3.3</a>.  (You might want to run it now to remind yourself
of what it can do.)  In that program, the user can use the
mouse to draw simple sketches.  Now, we will add file input/output capabilities
to that program.  This will allow the user to save a sketch to a file and later read
the sketch back from the file into the program so that the user can continue
to work on the sketch.  The basic requirement is that all relevant data
about the sketch must be saved in the file, so that the sketch can be
exactly restored when the file is read by the program.</p>
   
 

<p>The new version of the program can be found in the source code
file <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter11/SimplePaintWithFiles.java">SimplePaintWithFiles.java</a></span>.  A "File" menu
has been added to the new version.  It implements "Save" and
"Open" commands for writing program data to a file and reading
saved data back into the program.</p>
   

<p>The data for a sketch consists of the background color of the picture
and a list of the curves that were drawn by the user.  A curve consists of
a list of <span class="classname">Point2Ds</span>.  The class <span class="classname">Point2D</span> is
found in package <span class="code">javafx.geometry</span>; a <span class="classname">Point2D</span>,
<span class="code">pt</span>, has instance methods <span class="code">pt.getX()</span> and <span class="code">pt.getY()</span>
that return the coordinates of a point in the xy-plane as values of type <span class="ptype">double</span>.
Each curve can be a different color.  Furthermore, a curve can be "symmetric," which
means that in addition to the curve itself, the horizontal and vertical reflections
of the curve are also drawn.  The data for each
curve are stored in an object of type <span class="classname">CurveData</span>, which
is defined in the program as:</p>
   

<pre>/**
 * An object of type CurveData represents the data required to redraw one
 * of the curves that have been sketched by the user.
 */
private static class CurveData {
   Color color;  // The color of the curve.
   boolean symmetric;  // Are horizontal and vertical reflections also drawn?
   ArrayList&lt;Point2D&gt; points;  // The points on the curve.
}</pre>
   

<p>Then, a list of type <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;CurveData&gt;</span> is used to hold
data for all of the curves that the user has drawn.</p>
   

<p>Let's think about how the data for a sketch could be saved to a text file/
The basic idea is that all data necessary to reconstitute
a sketch must be saved to the output file in some definite format.  The method
that reads the file must follow exactly the same format as it reads the data,
and it must use the data to rebuild the data structures that represent the sketch
while the program is running.</p>
   

<p>When writing character data, all of the data has to be expressed, ultimately, in terms of simple 
data values such as strings and primitive type values.  A color, for example,
can be expressed in terms of three numbers giving the red, green, and blue
components of the color.  The first (not very good) idea that comes to mind might be to
just dump all the necessary data, in some definite order, into the file.
Suppose that <span class="code">out</span> is a <span class="classname">PrintWriter</span> that
is used to write to the file.  We could then say:</p>


<pre>Color bgColor = getBackground();    // Write the background color to the file.
out.println( bgColor.getRed() );
out.println( bgColor.getGreen() );
out.println( bgColor.getBlue() );

out.println( curves.size() );       // Write the number of curves.
   
for ( CurveData curve : curves ) {  // For each curve, write...
   out.println( curve.color.getRed() );      // the color of the curve
   out.println( curve.color.getGreen() );   
   out.println( curve.color.getBlue() );
   out.println( curve.symmetric ? 0 : 1 );   // the curve's symmetry property
   out.println( curve.points.size() );       // the number of points on curve
   for ( Point2D pt : curve.points ) {       // the coordinates of each point
      out.println( pt.getX() );
      out.println( pt.getY() );
   }
}</pre>
   

<p>This works in the sense that the file-reading method can read the
data and rebuild the data structures.  Suppose that the input method uses
a <span class="classname">Scanner</span> named <span class="code">scanner</span> to read
the data file.  Then it could say:</p>
   

<pre>Color newBackgroundColor;                // Read the background Color.
double red = scanner.nextDouble();
double green = scanner.nextDouble();
double blue = scanner.nextDouble();
newBackgroundColor = Color.color(red,green,blue);

ArrayList&lt;CurveData&gt; newCurves = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
   
int curveCount = scanner.nextInt();      // The number of curves to be read.
for (int i = 0; i &lt; curveCount; i++) {
   CurveData curve = new CurveData();
   double r = scanner.nextDouble();            // Read the curve's color.
   double g = scanner.nextDouble();
   double b = scanner.nextDouble();
   curve.color = Color.color(r,g,b);
   int symmetryCode = scanner.nextInt(); // Read the curve's symmetry property.
   curve.symmetric = (symmetryCode == 1);
   curveData.points = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
   int pointCount = scanner.nextInt();  // The number of points on this curve.
   for (int j = 0; j &lt; pointCount; j++) {
      int x = scanner.nextDouble();        // Read the coordinates of the point.
      int y = scanner.nextDouble();
      curveData.points.add(new Point2D(x,y));
   }
   newCurves.add(curve);
}

curves = newCurves;                     // Install the new data structures.
setBackground(newBackgroundColor);</pre>
   
   

<p>Note how every piece of data that was written by the output method is
read, in the same order, by the input method.  While this does work, the
data file is just a long string of numbers.  It doesn't make much more sense
to a human reader than a binary-format file would.  Furthermore, it is still
fragile in the sense that any small change made to the data representation
in the program, such as adding a new property to curves, will render the
data file useless (unless you happen to remember exactly which version of
the program created the file).</p>
   

<p>So, I decided to use a more complex, more meaningful data
format for the text files created by my program.  Instead of just
writing numbers, I add <b>words</b> to say what the numbers mean.
Here is a short but complete data file for the program; just by
looking at it, you can probably tell what is going on:</p>


<pre>SimplePaintWithFiles 1.0
background 0.4 0.4 0.5

startcurve
  color 1 1 1
  symmetry true
  coords 10 10
  coords 200 250
  coords 300 10
endcurve

startcurve
  color 0 1 1
  symmetry false
  coords 10 400
  coords 590 400
endcurve</pre>   


<p>The first line of the file identifies the program that created the
data file; when the user selects a file to be opened, the program can check
the first word in the file as a simple test to make sure the file
is of the correct type.  The first line also contains a version number,
1.0.  If the file format changes in a later version of the program, a
higher version number would be used; if the program sees a version number
of 1.2 in a file, but the program only understands version 1.0, the
program can explain to the user that a newer version of the program is
needed to read the data file.</p>
   

<p>The second line of the file specifies the background color of the
picture.  The three numbers specify the red, green, and blue components
of the color.  The word "background" at the beginning of the line makes
the meaning clear.  The remainder of the file consists of data for the
curves that appear in the picture.  The data for each curve is clearly
marked with "startcurve" and "endcurve."  The data consists of the color
and symmetry properties of the curve and the xy-coordinates of each
point on the curve.  Again, the meaning is clear.  Files in this format
can easily be created or edited by hand.  In fact, the data file shown
above was actually created in a text editor rather than by the program.
Furthermore, it's easy to extend the format to allow for additional options.
Future versions of the program could add a "thickness" property to the
curves to make it possible to have curves with differing line widths.
Shapes such as rectangles and ovals could easily be added.</p>
   

<p>Outputting data in this format is easy.  Suppose that <span class="code">out</span>
is a <span class="classname">PrintWriter</span> that is being used to write
the sketch data to a file.  Then the output is be done with:</p>
   

<pre>out.println("SimplePaintWithFiles 1.0"); // Version number.
out.println( "background " + backgroundColor.getRed() + " " +
        backgroundColor.getGreen() + " " + backgroundColor.getBlue() );
for ( CurveData curve : curves ) {
    out.println();
    out.println("startcurve");
    out.println("  color " + curve.color.getRed() + " " +
            curve.color.getGreen() + " " + curve.color.getBlue() );
    out.println( "  symmetry " + curve.symmetric );
    for ( Point2D pt : curve.points )
        out.println( "  coords " + pt.getX() + " " + pt.getY() );
    out.println("endcurve");
}</pre>


<p>In the program, this code is used in a <span class="code">doSave()</span> method that
is similar to the one that is presented in <a href="../c11/s2.html#IO.2.3">Subsection&nbsp;11.2.3</a>.  The method
uses a file dialog box to allow the user to select the output file.</p>
   

<p>Reading the data is somewhat harder, since the input routine has to
deal with all the extra words in the data.  In my input routine,
I decided to allow some variation in the order in which the data occurs in the
file.  For example, the background color can be specified at
the end of the file, instead of at the beginning.  It can
even be left out altogether, in which case white will be used
as the default background color.  This is possible because
each item of data is labeled with a word that describes its
meaning; the labels can be used to drive the processing of
the input.  Here is the complete method from <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter11/SimplePaintWithFiles.java">SimplePaintWithFiles.java</a></span>
that reads data files created by the <span class="code">doSave()</span> method.  It uses a
<span class="classname">Scanner</span> to read items from the file:</p>
   

<pre>private void doOpen() {
    FileChooser fileDialog = new FileChooser();
    fileDialog.setTitle("Select File to be Opened");
    fileDialog.setInitialFileName(null);  // No file is initially selected.
    if (editFile == null)
        fileDialog.setInitialDirectory(new File(System.getProperty("user.home")));
    else
        fileDialog.setInitialDirectory(editFile.getParentFile());
    File selectedFile = fileDialog.showOpenDialog(window);
    if (selectedFile == null)
        return;  // User canceled.
    Scanner scanner;
    try {
        scanner = new Scanner( selectedFile );
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
        Alert errorAlert = new Alert(Alert.AlertType.ERROR,
                "Sorry, but an error occurred\nwhile trying to open the file.");
        errorAlert.showAndWait();
        return;
    }
    try {
        String programName = scanner.next();
        if ( ! programName.equals("SimplePaintWithFiles") )
            throw new IOException("File is not a SimplePaintWithFiles data file.");
        double version = scanner.nextDouble();
        if (version &gt; 1.0)
            throw new IOException("File requires a newer version of SimplePaintWithFiles.");
        Color newBackgroundColor = Color.WHITE;

                    if (itemName.equalsIgnoreCase("color")) {
                        double r = scanner.nextDouble();
                        double g = scanner.nextDouble();
                        double b = scanner.nextDouble();
                        curve.color = Color.color(r,g,b);
                    }
                    else if (itemName.equalsIgnoreCase("symmetry")) {
                        curve.symmetric = scanner.nextBoolean();
                    }
                    else if (itemName.equalsIgnoreCase("coords")) {
                        double x = scanner.nextDouble();
                        double y = scanner.nextDouble();
                        curve.points.add( new Point2D(x,y) );
                    }
                    else {

                newCurves.add(curve);

                "Sorry, but an error occurred while\ntrying to read the data:\n"

<p>The main reason for this long discussion of file formats has been to
get you to think about the problem of representing complex data in a form suitable
for storing the data in a file.  The same problem arises when data must
be transmitted over a network.  There is no one correct solution to the
problem, but some solutions are certainly better than others.  In
<a href="../c11/s5.html">Section&nbsp;11.5</a>, we will look at one solution to the data
representation problem that has become increasingly common.</p>

<p>In addition to being able to save sketch data in  text form, 
<span class="code">SimplePaintWithFiles</span> can also save the
picture itself as an image file that could be, for example, printed
or put on a web page.  This is a preview of image-handling techniques
that will be covered in <a href="../c13/s2.html#GUI2.2.6">Subsection&nbsp;13.2.6</a>, and it uses
techniques that I have not yet covered.</p>
