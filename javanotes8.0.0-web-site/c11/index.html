<span class="start"><big>C</big>omputer programs are</span> only useful if they interact
with the rest of the world in some way. This interaction is referred to as
<span class="newword">input/output</span>, or <span class="newword">I/O</span> (pronounced "eye-oh"). 
Up until now, this book has concentrated on just one 
type of interaction: interaction with the user, through either a
graphical user interface or a command-line interface. But the user is only one
possible source of information and only one possible destination for
information. We have already encountered one other type of input/output, since
<span class="classname">TextIO</span> can read data from files and write data
to files.  However, Java has an input/output framework that provides much
more power and flexibility than does <span class="classname">TextIO</span>,
and that covers other kinds of I/O in addition to files.  Most important, aside from
files, is that it supports communication over network connections.
In Java, the most common type of input/output involving files and networks is based on
<span class="newword">I/O&nbsp;streams</span>, which are objects that support I/O
commands that are similar to those that you have already used.
In fact, standard output (<span class="code">System.out</span>) and
standard input (<span class="code">System.in</span>) are examples of I/O streams.
(Note that I/O streams are <b>not</b> streams in the sense of the stream
API that was covered in <a href="../c10/s6.html">Section&nbsp;10.6</a>.)</p>


<p>Working with files and networks requires familiarity with exceptions, which
were covered in <a href="../c8/s3.html">Section&nbsp;8.3</a>. Many of
the subroutines that are used can throw checked exceptions, which require mandatory
exception handling. This generally means calling the subroutine in a
<span class="code">try..catch</span> statement that can deal with the exception if one
occurs.  Effective network communication also requires the use of
threads, which will be covered in <a href="../c12/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;12</a>.
We will look at the basic networking API in this chapter, but
we will return to the topic of threads and networking in <a href="../c12/s4.html">Section&nbsp;12.4</a>.
