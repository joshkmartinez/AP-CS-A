<hr class="break">


<p>
<span class="start"><big>S</big>tatements in Java can</span> be either simple statements
or compound statements. Simple statements, such as assignment statements and
subroutine call statements, are the basic building blocks of a program.
Compound statements, such as <span class="code">while</span> loops and <span class="code">if</span> statements,
are used to organize simple statements into complex structures, which are
called control structures because they control the order in which the
statements are executed. The next five sections explore the details of
control structures that are available in Java, starting with the <span class="code">while</span>
statement and the <span class="code">do..while</span> statement in this section. At the same
time, we'll look at examples of programming with each control structure and
apply the techniques for designing algorithms that were introduced in the
<a href="../c3/s2.html">previous&nbsp;section</a>.</p>



<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="control.3.1">3.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;The while Statement</a>
</h3>


<p>The <span class="code">while</span> statement was already introduced in <a href="../c3/s1.html">Section&nbsp;3.1</a>. 
A <span class="code">while</span> loop has the form</p>


<pre>while ( <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span> )
   <span class="bnf">statement</span>
</pre>


<p>The <span class="bnf">statement</span> can, of course, be a block
statement consisting of several statements grouped together between a pair of
braces. This statement is called the <span class="newword">body of the loop</span>. 
The body of the loop is repeated as long as the <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span> is true. This boolean expression is
called the <span class="newword">continuation condition</span>, or more simply
the <span class="newword">test</span>, of the loop. There are a few points that
might need some clarification. What happens if the condition is false in the
first place, before the body of the loop is executed even once? In that case,
the body of the loop is never executed at all. The body of a while loop can be
executed any number of times, including zero. What happens if the condition is
true, but it becomes false somewhere in the <b>middle</b> of the loop
body? Does the loop end as soon as this happens? It doesn't, because the
computer continues executing the body of the loop until it gets to the end.
Only then does it jump back to the beginning of the loop and test the
condition, and only then can the loop end.</p>


<p>Let's look at a typical problem that can be solved using a <span class="code">while</span>
loop: finding the average of a set of positive integers entered by the user.
The average is the sum of the integers, divided by the number of integers. The
program will ask the user to enter one integer at a time. It will keep count of
the number of integers entered, and it will keep a running total of all the
numbers it has read so far. Here is a pseudocode algorithm for the program:</p>


<pre>Let sum = 0     // The sum of the integers entered by the user.
Let count = 0   // The number of integers entered by the user.
while there are more integers to process:
    Read an integer
    Add it to the sum
    Count it
Divide sum by count to get the average
Print out the average</pre>


<p>But how can we test whether there are more integers to process? A typical
solution is to tell the user to type in zero after all the data have been
entered. This will work because we are assuming that all the data are positive
numbers, so zero is not a legal data value. The zero is not itself part of the
data to be averaged. It's just there to mark the end of the real data. A data
value used in this way is sometimes called a <span class="newword">sentinel value</span>. 
So now the test in the while loop becomes "while the input
integer is not zero". But there is another problem! The first time the test is
evaluated, before the body of the loop has ever been executed, no integer has
yet been read. There is no "input integer" yet, so testing whether the input
integer is zero doesn't make sense. So, we have to do something
<b>before</b> the while loop to make sure that the test makes sense.
Setting things up so that the test in a <span class="code">while</span> loop makes sense the
first time it is executed is called <span class="newword">priming the loop</span>. 
In this case, we can simply read the first integer before the
beginning of the loop. Here is a revised algorithm:</p>


<pre>Let sum = 0
Let count = 0
Read an integer
while the integer is not zero:
    Add the integer to the sum
    Count it
    Read an integer
Divide sum by count to get the average
Print out the average</pre>


<p>Notice that I've rearranged the body of the loop. Since an integer is read
before the loop, the loop has to begin by processing that integer. At the end
of the loop, the computer reads a new integer. The computer then jumps back to
the beginning of the loop and tests the integer that it has just read. Note
that when the computer finally reads the sentinel value, the loop ends before
the sentinel value is processed. It is not added to the sum, and it is not
counted. This is the way it's supposed to work. The sentinel is not part of the
data. The original algorithm, even if it could have been made to work without
priming, was incorrect since it would have summed and counted all the integers,
including the sentinel. (Since the sentinel is zero, the sum would still be
correct, but the count would be off by one. Such so-called <span class="newword">off-by-one errors</span> 
are very common. Counting turns out to be
harder than it looks!)</p>


<p>We can easily turn the algorithm into a complete program. Note that the
program cannot use the statement "<span class="code">average&nbsp;=&nbsp;sum/count</span>;" to compute the
average. Since <span class="code">sum</span> and <span class="code">count</span> are both variables of type
<span class="ptype">int</span>, the value of <span class="code">sum/count</span> is an integer. The average should
be a real number. We've seen this problem before: we have to convert one of the
<span class="ptype">int</span> values to a <span class="ptype">double</span> to force the computer to compute the
quotient as a real number. This can be done by type-casting one of the
variables to type <span class="ptype">double</span>. The type cast "(double)sum" converts the
value of <span class="code">sum</span> to a real number, so in the program the average is
computed as "<span class="code">average&nbsp;= ((double)sum)&nbsp;/&nbsp;count</span>;". Another solution in
this case would have been to declare <span class="code">sum</span> to be a variable of type
<span class="ptype">double</span> in the first place.</p>


<p>One other issue is addressed by the program: If the user enters zero as the
first input value, there are no data to process. We can test for this case by
checking whether <span class="code">count</span> is still equal to zero after the <span class="code">while</span>
loop. This might seem like a minor point, but a careful programmer should cover
all the bases.</p>



<p>Here is the full source code for the program (with comments added, of course!):</p>


<pre>import textio.TextIO;

/**
 * This program reads a sequence of positive integers input
 * by the user, and it will print out the average of those
 * integers.  The user is prompted to enter one integer at a
 * time.  The user must enter a 0 to mark the end of the
 * data.  (The zero is not counted as part of the data to
 * be averaged.)  The program does not check whether the
 * user's input is positive, so it will actually add up
 * both positive and negative input values.
 */
public class ComputeAverage {
        
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      
      int inputNumber;   // One of the integers input by the user.
      int sum;           // The sum of the positive integers.

         count++;              // Count the input by adding 1 to count.

         inputNumber = TextIO.getlnInt();
      }
      
      /* Display the result. */
      
      if (count == 0) {
         System.out.println("You didn't enter any data!");
      }
      else {
         average = ((double)sum) / count;
         System.out.println();
         System.out.println("You entered " + count + " positive integers.");
         System.out.printf("Their average is %1.3f.\n", average);

<a name="control.3.2">3.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;The do..while Statement</a>
</h3>
   


<p>Sometimes it is more convenient to test the continuation condition at the
end of a loop, instead of at the beginning, as is done in the <span class="code">while</span>
loop. The <span class="code">do..while</span> statement is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
statement, except that the word "while," along with the condition that it
tests, has been moved to the end. The word "do" is added to mark the beginning
of the loop. A <span class="code">do..while</span> statement has the form</p>


<pre>do
    <span class="bnf">statement</span>
while ( <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span> );</pre>


<p>or, since, as usual, the <span class="bnf">statement</span> can be a
block,</p>


<pre>do {
    <span class="bnf">statements</span>
} while ( <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span> );</pre>


<p>Note the semicolon, ';', at the very  end. This semicolon is part of the
statement, just as the semicolon at the end of an assignment statement or
declaration is part of the statement. Omitting it is a syntax error. (More
generally, <b>every</b> statement in Java ends either with a
semicolon or a right brace, '}'.)</p>


<p>To execute a <span class="code">do</span> loop, the computer first executes the body of the
loop&mdash;that is, the statement or statements inside the loop&mdash;and then it
evaluates the boolean expression. If the value of the expression is
<span class="code">true</span>, the computer returns to the beginning of the <span class="code">do</span> loop and repeats
the process; if the value is <span class="code">false</span>, it ends the loop and continues
with the next part of the program. Since the condition is not tested until the
end of the loop, the body of a <span class="code">do</span> loop is always executed at least once.</p>


<p>For example, consider the following pseudocode for a game-playing program.
The <span class="code">do</span> loop makes sense here instead of a <span class="code">while</span> loop because
with the <span class="code">do</span> loop, you know there will be at least one game. Also, the
test that is used at the end of the loop wouldn't even make sense at the
beginning:</p>


<pre>do {
   Play a Game
   Ask user if he wants to play another game
   Read the user's response
} while ( the user's response is yes );</pre>


<p>Let's convert this into proper Java code. Since I don't want to talk about
game playing at the moment, let's say that we have a class named
<span class="code">Checkers</span>, and that the <span class="code">Checkers</span> class contains a static
member subroutine named <span class="code">playGame()</span> that plays one game of checkers
against the user. Then, the pseudocode "Play a game" can be expressed as the
subroutine call statement "<span class="code">Checkers.playGame();</span>". We need a variable
to store the user's response. The <span class="classname">TextIO</span> class makes it convenient to
use a <span class="ptype">boolean</span> variable to store the answer to a yes/no question. The
input function <span class="code">TextIO.getlnBoolean()</span> allows the user to enter the
value as "yes" or "no" (among other acceptable responses). 
"Yes" is considered to be <span class="code">true</span>, and "no" is
considered to be <span class="code">false</span>. So, the algorithm can be coded as</p>


<pre>boolean wantsToContinue;  // True if user wants to play again.
do {
   Checkers.playGame();
   System.out.print("Do you want to play again? ");
   wantsToContinue = TextIO.getlnBoolean();
} while (wantsToContinue == true);</pre>


<p>When the value of the <span class="ptype">boolean</span> variable is set to <span class="code">false</span>, it
is a signal that the loop should end. When a <span class="ptype">boolean</span> variable is used
in this way&mdash;as a signal that is set in one part of the program and tested in
another part&mdash;it is sometimes called a <span class="newword">flag</span> or
<span class="newword">flag variable</span> (in the sense of a signal flag).</p>


<p>By the way, a more-than-usually-pedantic programmer would sneer at the test
"<span class="code">while (wantsToContinue == true)</span>". This test is exactly equivalent to
"<span class="code">while (wantsToContinue)</span>". Testing whether "<span class="code">wantsToContinue&nbsp;==&nbsp;true</span>" 
is true amounts to the same thing as testing whether
"<span class="code">wantsToContinue</span>" is true. A little less offensive is an expression of
the form "<span class="code">flag&nbsp;==&nbsp;false</span>", where <span class="code">flag</span> is a boolean variable.
The value of "<span class="code">flag&nbsp;==&nbsp;false</span>" is exactly the same as the value of
"<span class="code">!flag</span>", where <span class="code">!</span> is the boolean negation operator. So you can
write "<span class="code">while&nbsp;(!flag)</span>" instead of "<span class="code">while (flag&nbsp;==&nbsp;false)</span>", and
you can write "<span class="code">if&nbsp;(!flag)</span>" instead of "<span class="code">if&nbsp;(flag&nbsp;==&nbsp;false)</span>".</p>


<p>Although a <span class="code">do..while</span> statement is sometimes more convenient than a
<span class="code">while</span> statement, having two kinds of loops does not make the language
more powerful. Any problem that can be solved using <span class="code">do..while</span> loops
can also be solved using only <span class="code">while</span> statements, and vice versa. In
fact, if <span class="bnf">doSomething</span> represents any block of
program code, then</p>


<pre>do {
    <span class="bnf">doSomething</span>
} while ( <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span> );</pre>


<p>has exactly the same effect as</p>


<pre>
<span class="bnf">doSomething</span>
while ( <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span> ) {
    <span class="bnf">doSomething</span>
}</pre>


<p>Similarly,</p>


<pre>while ( <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span> ) {
    <span class="bnf">doSomething</span>
} </pre>


<p>can be replaced by</p>


<pre>if ( <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span> ) {
   do {
       <span class="bnf">doSomething</span>
   } while ( <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span> );
}</pre>


<p>without changing the meaning of the program in any way.</p>



   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="control.3.3">3.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;break and continue</a>
</h3>


<p>The syntax of the <span class="code">while</span> and <span class="code">do..while</span> loops allows you to
test the continuation condition at either the beginning of a loop or at the
end. Sometimes, it is more natural to have the test in the middle of the loop,
or to have several tests at different places in the same loop. Java provides a
general method for breaking out of the middle of any loop. It's called the
<span class="code">break</span> statement, which takes the form</p>


<pre>break;</pre>


<p>When the computer executes a <span class="code">break</span> statement in a loop, it will
immediately jump out of the loop. It then continues on to whatever follows the
loop in the program. Consider for example:</p>


<pre>while (true) {  // looks like it will run forever!
   System.out.print("Enter a positive number: ");
   N = TextIO.getlnInt();
   if (N &gt; 0)   // the input value is OK, so jump out of loop
      break;
   System.out.println("Your answer must be &gt; 0.");
}
// continue here after break</pre>


<p>If the number entered by the user is greater than zero, the <span class="code">break</span>
statement will be executed and the computer will jump out of the loop.
Otherwise, the computer will print out "Your answer must be &gt; 0." and will
jump back to the start of the loop to read another input value.</p>


<p>The first line of this loop, "<span class="code">while&nbsp;(true)</span>" might look a bit
strange, but it's perfectly legitimate. The condition in a <span class="code">while</span> loop
can be any boolean-valued expression. The computer evaluates this expression
and checks whether the value is <span class="code">true</span> or <span class="code">false</span>. The boolean
literal "<span class="code">true</span>" is just a boolean expression that always evaluates to
true. So "<span class="code">while&nbsp;(true)</span>" can be used to write an infinite loop, or one
that will be terminated by a <span class="code">break</span> statement.</p>


<p>A <span class="code">break</span> statement terminates the loop that immediately encloses the
<span class="code">break</span> statement. It is possible to have <span class="newword">nested</span> loops, 
where one loop statement is contained inside
another. If you use a <span class="code">break</span> statement inside a nested loop, it will
only break out of that loop, not out of the loop that contains the nested loop. 
There is something called a <span class="newword">labeled break</span> statement that allows you to
specify which loop you want to break. This is not very common, so I will go over it quickly.
Labels work like this:  You can put a <span class="newword">label</span> in
front of any loop.  A label consists of a simple identifier followed
by a colon.  For example, a <span class="code">while</span> with a label might
look like "<span class="code">mainloop:&nbsp;while...</span>".  Inside
this loop you can use the labeled break statement "<span class="code">break&nbsp;mainloop;</span>"
to break out of the labeled loop.  For example, here is a code segment that checks
whether two strings, <span class="code">s1</span> and <span class="code">s2</span>, have a character in common.
If a common character is found, the value of the flag variable <span class="code">nothingInCommon</span>
is set to <span class="code">false</span>, and a labeled break is used to end the processing
at that point:</p>


<pre>boolean nothingInCommon;
nothingInCommon = true;  // Assume s1 and s2 have no chars in common.
int i,j;  // Variables for iterating through the chars in s1 and s2.

i = 0;
bigloop: while (i &lt; s1.length()) {
   j = 0;
   while (j &lt; s2.length()) {
      if (s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(j)) { // s1 and s2 have a common char...
          nothingInCommon = false;  // so nothingInCommon is actually false.
          break bigloop;  // break out of BOTH loops
      }
      j++;  // Go on to the next char in s2.
   }
   i++;  //Go on to the next char in s1.
}</pre>


<hr class="break">
   

<p>The <span class="code">continue</span> statement is related to <span class="code">break</span>, but less
commonly used. A <span class="code">continue</span> statement tells the computer to skip the
rest of the current iteration of the loop. However, instead of jumping out of
the loop altogether, it jumps back to the beginning of the loop and continues
with the next iteration (including evaluating the loop's continuation condition to
see whether any further iterations are required).  As with <span class="code">break</span>,
when a <span class="code">continue</span> is in a nested loop, it will continue the loop
that directly contains it; a "labeled continue" can be used to continue
the containing loop instead.</p>


<p>
<span class="code">break</span> and <span class="code">continue</span> can be used in <span class="code">while</span> loops and
<span class="code">do..while</span> loops. They can also be used in <span class="code">for</span> loops, which
are covered in the <a href="../c3/s4.html">next&nbsp;section</a>. 
In <a href="../c3/s6.html">Section&nbsp;3.6</a>, we'll see that <span class="code">break</span> can also be used to
break out of a <span class="code">switch</span> statement.   A <span class="code">break</span> can occur
inside an <span class="code">if</span> statement, but only if the <span class="code">if</span> statement
is nested inside a loop or inside a <span class="code">switch</span> statement.
In that case, it does <b>not</b> mean
to break out of the <span class="code">if</span>.  Instead, it breaks out of the loop or
<span class="code">switch</span> statement that contains the <span class="code">if</span> statement.
The same consideration applies to <span class="code">continue</span> statements inside <span class="code">ifs</span>.</p>
