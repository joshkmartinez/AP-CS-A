<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 3.4</h2>

<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 3.4:</h3>
<p>Write a program that reads
one line of input text and breaks it up into words. The words should be output
one per line. A word is defined to be a sequence of letters. Any characters in
the input that are not letters should be discarded. For example, if the user
inputs the line</p>


<pre>He said, "That's not a good idea."</pre>


<p>then the output of the program should be</p>


<pre>He
said
That
s
not
a
good
idea</pre>


<p>An improved version of the program would list "that's" as a single word. An
apostrophe can be considered to be part of a word if there is a letter on each
side of the apostrophe.</p>


<p>To test whether a character is a letter, you might use <span class="code">(ch &gt;= 'a'
&amp;&amp; ch &lt;= 'z') || (ch &gt;= 'A' &amp;&amp; ch &lt;= 'Z')</span>.
However, this only works in English and similar languages. A better choice is
to call the standard function <span class="code">Character.isLetter(ch)</span>, which returns a
boolean value of <span class="code">true</span> if <span class="code">ch</span> is a letter and <span class="code">false</span> if
it is not. This works for any Unicode character.</p>

<p>There are many ways to approach this problem, and probably all of them are
sort of tricky to get right. Here's a simple idea that almost works: Go through
all the characters in the string. If the character is a letter, write it out.
If it's not a letter, write a carriage return instead. If <span class="code">line</span> is a
<span class="classname">String</span> variable representing the line of text, this algorithm can be
coded as</p>


<pre>for ( i = 0;  i &lt; line.length(); i++ ) {
   ch = line.charAt(i);
   if ( Character.isLetter(ch) )
      System.out.print(ch);
   else
      System.out.println();   
}</pre>


<p>This prints all the letters in a word on the same line of output. Since
words in the string are separated by non-letter characters, and the computer
prints a carriage return when it finds a non-letter, words in the output are
separated by carriage returns. But there are is a problem with this: If two
words in the string are separated by <b>several</b> non-letters, then
there will be one or more blank lines between the words in the output. We don't
want to output two carriage returns in a row. To avoid this, we can keep track
of whether the previous output was a letter or a carriage return. When we find
a non-letter, we will output a carriage return only if the previous output was
<b>not</b> a carriage return. To keep track of the necessary
information, I'll use a <span class="ptype">boolean</span> variable named <span class="code">didCR</span>. The
value of this variable will be true if the previous output was a carriage
return. I have to remember to set the value of <span class="code">didCR</span> each time I
output something. With this modification, the code becomes:</p>


<pre>for ( i = 0;  i &lt; line.length(); i++ ) {
   ch = line.charAt(i);
   if ( Character.isLetter(ch) ) {
      System.out.print(ch);
      didCR = false;  // previous output was not a CR
   }
   else {
      if ( didCR == false ) {  // output CR, if previous output was NOT a CR
         System.out.println();
         didCR = true;  // previous output was a CR
      }
   }
}</pre>


<p>The program requires an initial value for <span class="code">didCR</span>. In the program
below, I output a carriage return before the <span class="code">for</span> loop and set
<span class="code">didCR</span> to true. You should be able to follow the rest of the
program.</p>


<p>An entirely different approach to this problem is given by the algorithm,
"while there are more words in the string, get the next word and print it."
This turns out to be even harder to implement than the above.</p>
