<p>How many times do you have
to roll a pair of dice before they come up snake eyes? You could do the
experiment by rolling the dice by hand. Write a computer program that simulates
the experiment. The program should report the number of rolls that it makes
before the dice come up snake eyes. (Note: "Snake eyes" means that both dice
show a value of 1.) <a href="../c2/ex2-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;2.2</a> explained how to simulate rolling a pair of dice.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 3.2:</h3>
<p>Which integer between 1
and 10000 has the largest number of divisors, and how many divisors does it
have? Write a program to find the answers and print out the results. It is
possible that several integers in this range have the same, maximum number of
divisors. Your program only has to print out one of them.  An example in
<a href="../c3/s4.html#control.4.2">Subsection&nbsp;3.4.2</a> discussed divisors. The source code for
that example is <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter3/CountDivisors.java">CountDivisors.java</a></span>.</p>


<p>You might need some hints about how to find a maximum value. The basic idea
is to go through all the integers, keeping track of the largest number of
divisors that you've seen <i>so far</i>. Also, keep track of the integer that
had that number of divisors.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 3.3:</h3>
<p>Write a program that will
evaluate simple expressions such as 17 + 3 and 3.14159 * 4.7. The expressions
are to be typed in by the user. The input always consists of a number, followed
by an operator, followed by another number. The operators that are allowed are
+, -, *, and /. You can read the numbers with <span class="code">TextIO.getDouble()</span> and
the operator with <span class="code">TextIO.getChar()</span>. Your program should read an
expression, print its value, read another expression, print its value, and so
on. The program should end when the user enters 0 as the first number on the
line.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 3.4:</h3>
<p>Write a program that reads
one line of input text and breaks it up into words. The words should be output
one per line. A word is defined to be a sequence of letters. Any characters in
the input that are not letters should be discarded. For example, if the user
inputs the line</p>


<pre>He said, "That's not a good idea."</pre>


<p>then the output of the program should be</p>


<pre>He
said
That
s
not
a
good
idea</pre>


<p>An improved version of the program would list "that's" as a single word. An
apostrophe can be considered to be part of a word if there is a letter on each
side of the apostrophe.</p>


<p>To test whether a character is a letter, you might use <span class="code">(ch &gt;= 'a'
&amp;&amp; ch &lt;= 'z') || (ch &gt;= 'A' &amp;&amp; ch &lt;= 'Z')</span>.
However, this only works in English and similar languages. A better choice is
to call the standard function <span class="code">Character.isLetter(ch)</span>, which returns a
boolean value of <span class="code">true</span> if <span class="code">ch</span> is a letter and <span class="code">false</span> if
it is not. This works for any Unicode character.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 3.5:</h3>
<p>Suppose that a file contains information about sales 
figures for a company in various cities.
Each line of the file contains a city name, followed by a colon&nbsp;(:) followed by the data for that
city.  The data is a number of type <span class="ptype">double.</span>
However, for some cities, no data was available.  In these lines, the data is replaced by
a comment explaining why the data is missing.  For example, several lines from the file might
look like:</p>

<pre>San Francisco:  19887.32
Chicago:  no report received
New York: 298734.12</pre>

<p>Write a program that will compute and print the total sales from all the cities together. The
program should also report the number of cities for which data was not available.  The name of the
file is "sales.dat".</p>

<p>To complete this program, you'll need one fact about file input with <span class="classname">TextIO</span>
that was not covered in <a href="../c2/s4.html#basics.4.4">Subsection&nbsp;2.4.4</a>.  Since you don't know in advance how many
lines there are in the file, you need a way to tell when you have gotten to the end of the file.
When <span class="classname">TextIO</span> is reading from a file, the function <span class="code">TextIO.eof()</span>
can be used to test for <span class="newword">end of file</span>.  This <span class="ptype">boolean</span>-valued
function returns <span class="code">true</span> if the file has been entirely read and returns <span class="code">false</span>
if there is more data to read in the file.  This means that you can read the lines of the
file in a loop <span class="code">while&nbsp;(TextIO.eof()&nbsp;==&nbsp;false)...</span>. The loop will end
when all the lines of the file have been read.</p>

<p>Suggestion:  For each line, read and ignore characters up to the colon.  Then read the rest
of the line into a variable of type <span class="classname">String</span>.  Try to convert the string
into a number, and use <span class="code">try..catch</span> to test whether the conversion succeeds.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 3.6:</h3>
<p>
<a href="../c3/ex2-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;3.2</a> asked you to find the
number in the range 1 to 10000 that has the largest number of divisors.  You
only had to print out one such number.  Revise the program so that it will
print out <b>all</b> numbers that have the maximum number of divisors.  Use an
array as follows:  As you count the divisors for each number, store each
count in an array.  Then at the end of the program, 
you can go through the array and print out all the numbers
that have the maximum count.  The output from the program should look
something like this:</p>

<pre>Among integers between 1 and 10000,
The maximum number of divisors was 64
Numbers with that many divisors include:
   7560
   9240</pre>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 3.7:</h3>
<p>An example in <a href="../c3/s8.html#control.7a.3">Subsection&nbsp;3.8.3</a>
tried to answer the question, How many random people
do you have to select before you find a duplicate birthday? The source code for
that program can be found in the file
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter3/BirthdayProblem.java">BirthdayProblem.java</a></span>. Here are
some related questions:</p>

<ul>

<li>How many random people do you have to select before you find <b>three</b>
people who share the same birthday? (That is, all three people were born on the
same day in the same month, but not necessarily in the same year.)</li>

<li>Suppose you choose 365 people at random. How many different birthdays will
they have? (The number could theoretically be anywhere from 1 to 365).</li>

<li>How many different people do you have to check before you've found at least
one person with a birthday on each of the 365 days of the year?</li>

</ul>

<p>Write <b>three</b> programs to answer these questions. Each of your programs should simulate
choosing people at random and checking their birthdays. (In each case, ignore
the possibility of leap years.)</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 3.8:</h3>
<p>Write a GUI program that draws
a checkerboard.  Base your solution on the sample program
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter3/SimpleGraphicsStarter.java">SimpleGraphicsStarter.java</a></span>  You will draw
the checkerboard in the <span class="code">drawPicture()</span> subroutine, after
erasing the code that it already contains.</p>


<p>The checkerboard should be 400-by-400  pixels.  You can change the size of
the drawing area in <span class="code">SimpleGraphicsStarter.java</span> by modifying the
first two lines of the <span class="code">start()</span> subroutine to set <span class="code">width</span>
and <span class="code">height</span> to 400 instead of 800 and 600.  A checkerboard
contains 8 rows and 8 columns of squares.  If the size of the drawing area is 400,
that means that each square should be 50-by-50 pixels.  
The squares are red and black (or whatever other colors you choose). Here is a tricky way
to determine whether a given square should be red or black: The rows and columns can be
thought of as numbered from 0 to 7.  If the row number of the square and the
column number of the square are either both even or both odd, then the square is red.
Otherwise, it is black. Note that a square is just a rectangle in which the
height is equal to the width, so you can use the subroutine
<span class="code">g.fillRect()</span> to draw the squares. Here is a reduced-size image of the
checkerboard that you want to draw:</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 3.9:</h3>
<p>Often, some element of an animation repeats over and over, every so many frames.
Sometimes, the repetition is "cyclic,"  meaning that at the end it jumps back to the start.
Sometimes the repetition is "oscillating," like a back-and-forth motion where the second
half is the same as the first half played in reverse.</p>

<p>Write an animation that demonstrates both cyclic and oscillating motions at various speeds.
For cyclic motion, you can use a square that moves across the drawing area, then jumps back to
the start, and then repeats the same motion over and over.  For oscillating motion, you can do something
similar, but the square should move back and forth between the two edges of the drawing area; that is,
it moves left-to-right during the first half of the animation and then backwards from right-to-left
during the second half.  To write the program, you can start with a copy of
the sample program <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter3/SimpleAnimationStarter.java">SimpleAnimationStarter.java</a></span>.</p>

<p>A cyclic motion has to repeat every N frames for some value of N.  What you draw in some
frame of the animation depends on the <span class="code">frameNumber</span>.  The <span class="code">frameNumber</span> just keeps
increasing forever.  To implement cyclic motion, what you really want is a "cyclic frame number" that
takes on the values 0, 1, 2, ..., (N-1), 0, 1, 2, ..., (N-1), 0, 1, 2, ....  You can derive
the value that you need from <span class="code">frameNumber</span> simply by saying</p>

<pre>cyclicFrameNumber = frameNumber % N;</pre>

<p>Then, you just have to base what you draw on <span class="code">cyclicFrameNumber</span> instead of on
<span class="code">frameNumber</span>.  Similarly, for an oscillating animation, you need an
"oscillation frame number" that takes on the values  0, 1, 2, ... (N-1), N, (N-1), (N-2), ... 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 
and so on, repeating the back and forth motion forever.  You can compute the value that you need with</p>

<pre>oscilationFrameNumber = frameNumber % (2*N);
if (oscillationFrameNumber &gt; N)
   oscillationFrameNumber = (2*N) - oscillationFrameNumber;</pre>

<p>Here is a screen shot from my version of the program.  I use
six squares.  The top three do cyclic motion at various speeds, while the bottom three do
oscillating motion.  I drew black lines across the drawing area to separate the squares and to give
them "channels" to move in.
