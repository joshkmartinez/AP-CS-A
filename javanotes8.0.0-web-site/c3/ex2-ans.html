<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 3.2:</h3>
<p>Which integer between 1
and 10000 has the largest number of divisors, and how many divisors does it
have? Write a program to find the answers and print out the results. It is
possible that several integers in this range have the same, maximum number of
divisors. Your program only has to print out one of them.  An example in
<a href="../c3/s4.html#control.4.2">Subsection&nbsp;3.4.2</a> discussed divisors. The source code for
that example is <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter3/CountDivisors.java">CountDivisors.java</a></span>.</p>


<p>You might need some hints about how to find a maximum value. The basic idea
is to go through all the integers, keeping track of the largest number of
divisors that you've seen <i>so far</i>. Also, keep track of the integer that
had that number of divisors.</p>

<hr>

<p>Let's use a variable named <span class="code">maxDivisors</span> to keep track of the largest
number of divisors we have seen so far and use <span class="code">numWithMax</span> to store the
number that had that many divisors. We have to compute the number of divisors
of each integer from 1 to 10000. Whenever we find a larger number of divisors
than <span class="code">maxDivisors</span>, we have to make note of that fact by changing the
values of <span class="code">maxDivisors</span> and <span class="code">numWithMax</span>. At the end of the
process, <span class="code">maxDivisors</span> will be the absolute maximum number of divisors
and <span class="code">numWithMax</span> will be a number that had that many divisors. These are
the values we want to print out. We can express this with a pseudocode
algorithm</p>


<pre>for each integer N from 1 to 10000:
   Count the number of divisors of N
   If that number is greater than maxDivisors:
       Let maxDivisors = the number of divisors of N
       Let numWithMax = N
Output maxDivisors and numWithMax</pre>


<p>However, there is a problem here: The very first time <span class="code">maxDivisors</span>
is used in the test "If that number is greater than maxDivisors," the variable
<span class="code">maxDivisors</span> hasn't yet been assigned a value. The computer will report
this as an error. This can be fixed by assigning a value to
<span class="code">maxDivisors</span> before the beginning of the <span class="code">for</span> loop. One way to
do this is to handle <span class="code">N=1</span> as a special case before the loop and then to
let <span class="code">N</span> go from 2 to 10000 in the for loop. We know that <span class="code">N=1</span>
has just 1 divisor:</p>


<pre>Let maxDivisors = 1  // number of divisors of 1
Let numWithMax = 1
for each integer N from 2 to 10000:
   Count the number of divisors of N
   If that number is greater than maxDivisors:
       Let maxDivisors = the number of divisors of N
       Let numWithMax = N
Output maxDivisors and numWithMax</pre>


<p>Here's a curious thing: If you leave out the line "<span class="code">numWithMax = 1</span>"
from the program, the computer will report a syntax error where you try to
output the value of <span class="code">numWithMax</span>. It will say that the variable
<span class="code">numWithMax</span> might not have been initialized. That is, it might never
have been assigned a value. Now, <b>you</b> know that it will be
assigned a value (since when <span class="code">N=2</span> is processed, <span class="code">numWithMax</span>
will become 2). However, when the computer compiles the program,
<b>it</b> doesn't know whether the body of the <span class="code">if</span> statement
will ever be executed, so it doesn't know whether <span class="code">numWithMax</span> will ever
be assigned a value. The syntax rule is that every variable must be "definitely
assigned" before its value is used. This means that it is assigned a value on
every possible execution path through the program.  Definite assignment was
discussed in <a href="../c3/s1.html#control.1.4">Subsection&nbsp;3.1.4</a>.</p>


<p>We still have to expand the step "Count the number of divisors of N." This
was already done in <a href="../c3/s4.html#control.4.2">Subsection&nbsp;3.4.2</a> for the example program
<span class="code">CountDivisors.java</span>. This step requires another <span class="code">for</span> loop, so
we have here an example of one <span class="code">for</span> loop nested inside another. Here is
a complete algorithm, which can be translated into a program:</p>


<pre>Let maxDivisors = 1  // number of divisors of 1
Let numWithMax = 1
for each integer N from 2 to 10000:
    Let divisorCount = 0
    for each D from 1 to N:
        if D is a divisor of N:
            add 1 to divisorCount
    If divisorCount is greater than maxDivisors:
        Let maxDivisors = the number of divisors of N
        Let numWithMax = N
Output maxDivisors and numWithMax</pre>


<p>This can be translated pretty much directly into a program. By the way, the
maximum number of divisors is 64. There are two numbers between 1 and 10000
that have 64 divisors, 7560 and 9240. The program will output the first of
these. (It would output the second if the test "<span class="code">if (divisorCount &gt;
maxDivisors)</span>" were changed to "<span class="code">if (divisorCount &gt;=
maxDivisors)</span>". Do you see why?)</p>
