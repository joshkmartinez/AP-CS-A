<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 3.7:</h3>
<p>An example in <a href="../c3/s8.html#control.7a.3">Subsection&nbsp;3.8.3</a>
tried to answer the question, How many random people
do you have to select before you find a duplicate birthday? The source code for
that program can be found in the file
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter3/BirthdayProblem.java">BirthdayProblem.java</a></span>. Here are
some related questions:</p>

<ul>

<li>How many random people do you have to select before you find <b>three</b>
people who share the same birthday? (That is, all three people were born on the
same day in the same month, but not necessarily in the same year.)</li>

<li>Suppose you choose 365 people at random. How many different birthdays will
they have? (The number could theoretically be anywhere from 1 to 365).</li>

<li>How many different people do you have to check before you've found at least
one person with a birthday on each of the 365 days of the year?</li>

</ul>

<p>Write <b>three</b> programs to answer these questions. Each of your programs should simulate
choosing people at random and checking their birthdays. (In each case, ignore
the possibility of leap years.)</p>

<hr>

<p>The original program and the three programs for this exercise have some similarities,
and we will use ideas from the original program.  However, each part of this exercise
presents its own problem.</p>

<p>The first question asks how many people you have to choose at random before
finding three who share the same birthday. This is similar to the original
program, but instead of just checking whether or not a given birthday has
already been found, we need to keep track of how many people have been found
with each birthday. Where the original program used an array of
<span class="code">booleans</span>, here we need an array of <span class="code">ints</span>. We still want to
count the number of people we check and output that count at the end. An
algorithm for the simulation is:</p>


<pre>Let count = 0
Repeat:
   Select a birthday at random
   Add one to count
   If this is the third time that birthday has occurred:
       break out of the loop
   Add one to the number of times that birthday has been found
Output the count</pre>


<p>The original program used a <span class="ptype">boolean</span> array to keep track of whether
or not each day had been seen.  For this proble, we need to know <i>how many times</i>
each day has been seen.  That means that instead of one boolean value for each day,
we need one integer value for each day.  So,
to do the counting, we need an array "<span class="code">int[] numFound</span>", where
<span class="code">numFound[i]</span> will be the number of times the <span class="code">i</span>-th day of the
year has occurred as a birthday. Since <span class="code">numFound[i]</span> can be used in any
way that any <span class="ptype">int</span> variable can be used, we can add one to the number
stored in <span class="code">numFound[i]</span> by saying "<span class="code">numFound[i]++</span>"
or "<span class="code">numFound[i]&nbsp;=&nbsp;numFound[i]&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</span>". When we
create the array with the command "<span class="code">numFound&nbsp;=&nbsp;new&nbsp;int[365]</span>", all the
elements of the array are automatically initialized to zero. This is the
initial value that we want. (This is an important thing to remember! In some
programming languages, arrays are not automatically filled with zeros, so it
would be necessary to use a <span class="code">for</span> loop to store a zero into each place
in the array. Even in Java, if you reuse
the same array rather than creating a new one for each use, you would
have to remember to set initialize each element of the array before reusing it.)</p>


<p>Given all this, we can translate the algorithm into Java as follows:</p>


<pre>
<span class="newcode">int[] numFound;  // numFound[i] will be the number of people
                 // who have been found who have a birthday
                 // on the i-th day of the year</span>

int count;       // The number of people who have been checked.

<span class="newcode">numFound = new int[365];  // Initially, all entries are 0.</span>

count = 0;

while (true) {
       // Select a birthday at random, from 0 to 364.
       // If the same birthday was already seen twice
       // before, then quit.  Otherwise, add one to
       // the corresponding entry in the numFound array
       // to record that a person with that birthday
       // has been found.
   int birthday;  // The selected birthday.
   birthday = (int)(Math.random()*365);
   count++;
   <span class="newcode">if ( numFound[birthday] == 2 )
       break;  // It's the third time we've found this birthday.
   numFound[birthday]++;</span>
}

System.out.println("It took " + count + 
        " tries to find three people with the same birthday.");</pre>


<p>The lines shown in red are the ones that differ significantly from the
original program. This becomes the body of the <span class="code">main()</span>
subroutine in the first program.</p>



<hr class="break">


<p>For the second program, we know exactly how many people we want to check:
365. This calls for using a for loop. The information we need for each birthday
is whether or not that birthday has occurred. For that, we can use an array of
<span class="ptype">booleans</span>.  After the <span class="code">for</span> loop,
value stored in position <span class="code">i</span> of the array will
<span class="code">true</span> if the <span class="code">i</span>-th day of the year has occurred as a birthday
and is <span class="code">false</span> if not. After checking 365 people, we have to go through
the boolean array and count the number of entries in the array that are <span class="code">true</span>.
This is the number of different birthdays that have been found. The algorithm
can be expressed as:</p>


<pre>Let used = new boolean[365]
Repeat 365 times:
   Select a birthday at random
   Store true into the corresponding location in the array, used
Let count = 0
for day = 0 to 364:
   If used[day] is true:
      Add 1 to count
Output the value of count</pre>


<p>This translates easily into Java code:</p>


<pre>boolean used[];  // used[i] will be true if a person is found
                 // whose birthday is the i-th day of the year.

used = new boolean[365];  // <b>Initially, all entries are false!</b>

for (i = 0; i &lt; 365; i++) {
      // Select a random birthday and record it.
   int birthday;  // The selected birthday.
   birthday = (int)(Math.random()*365);
   used[birthday] = true;
}

int count = 0;

for (day = 0; day &lt; 365; day++) {
       // If this day occurred as a birthday, count it.
   if (used[day] == true)
      count++;
}

System.out.println("Among 365 people, there were " + count
                                + " different birthdays.");</pre>


<p>It might be worth noting that the test "<span class="code">if&nbsp;(used[day]&nbsp;==&nbsp;true)</span>" can
be written more simply&mdash;and elegantly&mdash;as 
"<span class="code">if&nbsp;(used[day])</span>". Also, the three lines in
the first <span class="code">for</span> loop could be reduced to the single command
"<span class="code">used[(int)(Math.random()*365)]&nbsp;=&nbsp;true;</span>". Of course, this one-line
version is harder to understand.</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>The third program is just a little bit trickier. We have to continue
selecting people at random until we have found 365 different birthdays. We can
use a counter to keep track of how many different birthdays we have found. We
have to continue until this counter reaches 365. We need a second counter to
keep track of how many different people we have checked. It's the second
counter whose value we want to output at the end. Now, we have to be able to
recognize whether a birthday we've just found is new, or whether we've
encountered it previously. For this, we can again use an array of
<span class="ptype">booleans</span>. An algorithm for the simulation is:</p>


<pre>Let used = new boolean[365]
Let count = 0   // The number of people checked
Let birthdaysFound = 0   // The number of different birthdays found
while birthdaysFound &lt; 365:
   Add one to count
   Select a birthday at random
   if used[birthday] is false:
       Add one to birthdaysFound  // since this is a new birthday
   Let used[birthday] = true   // so we don't count it again
Output the value of count</pre>


<p>In Java, this algorithm becomes:</p>


<pre>boolean[] used;  // For recording the possible birthdays
                 //   that have been seen so far.
int count;       // The number of people who have been checked.
int birthdaysFound;   // The number of different birthdays that
                      // have been found.

used = new boolean[365];  // Initially, all entries are false.
count = 0;
birthdaysFound = 0;

while (birthdaysFound &lt; 365) {
       // Select a birthday at random, from 0 to 364.
       // If the birthday has not already been used,
       // add 1 to birthdaysFound.
   int birthday;  // The selected birthday.
   birthday = (int)(Math.random()*365);
   count++;
   if ( used[birthday] == false )
      birthdaysFound++;
   used[birthday] = true;
}

System.out.println( count + " people were checked." );</pre>
