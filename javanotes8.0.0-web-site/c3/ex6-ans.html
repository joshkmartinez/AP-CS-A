<p>
<a href="../c3/ex2-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;3.2</a> asked you to find the
number in the range 1 to 10000 that has the largest number of divisors.  You
only had to print out one such number.  Revise the program so that it will
print out <b>all</b> numbers that have the maximum number of divisors.  Use an
array as follows:  As you count the divisors for each number, store each
count in an array.  Then at the end of the program, 
you can go through the array and print out all the numbers
that have the maximum count.  The output from the program should look
something like this:</p>

<pre>Among integers between 1 and 10000,
The maximum number of divisors was 64
Numbers with that many divisors include:
   7560
   9240</pre>

<p>This is a fairly straightforward exercise in using arrays. We need to save 10000
numbers in an array.  The numbers are the divisor counts for the numbers 1 through 10000.
The numbers that we want to store in the array are of type <span class="ptype">int</span>,
so <span class="ptype">int</span> is the base type of the array.
In the program, I use an array named <span class="code">saveCount</span> of type <span class="atype">int[]</span>
to store the data.  It seems natural to store the divisor count for N in
array element <span class="code">saveCount[N]</span>, but note that in that case, we don't use
array element number 0, and we need an array element number 10000.  Ignoring element
0 is fine, but for <span class="code">saveCount[10000]</span> to exist, the length of the array
must be at least 10001.  I use an array of length 10001:</p>

<pre>saveCount = new int[10001];</pre>

<p>(An alternative would be to store the advisor count for N in
<span class="code">saveCount[N-1]</span>.  In that case, we wouldn't need the extra array element,
and the length of the array would be 10000.)</p>

<p>After computing each divisor count, we store the count in the array.  At the same
time, we are keeping track of the maximum number of divisors.  After the end of the <span class="code">for</span>
loop that does the counting, we know the divisor count for each number and we know the
maximum number of divisors.  We just have to go through the array and print out
every integer N for which the divisor count is equal to the maximum:</p>

<pre>System.out.println("Numbers with that many divisors include:");
for ( N = 1; N &lt;= 10000; N++ ) {
    if ( saveCount[N] == maxDivisors ) {
        System.out.println( "   " + N );
    }
}</pre>

<p>Note that this code checks whether the number in the array, <span class="code">saveCount[N]</span>,
is equal to the maximum, but it prints the array index, <span class="code">N</span>, which is the
integer that has that many divisors.</p>
