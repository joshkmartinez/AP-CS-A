<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>he second branching statement</span> in Java is the
<span class="code">switch</span> statement, which is introduced in this section. The
<span class="code">switch</span> statement is used far less often than the <span class="code">if</span> statement, but it
is sometimes useful for expressing a certain type of multiway branch.</p>

   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="control.6.1">3.6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;The Basic switch Statement</a>
</h3>


<p>A switch statement allows you to test the value of an expression and,
depending on that value, to jump directly to some location within the switch statement.
Only expressions of certain types can be used.  The value of the expression
can be one of the primitive integer types <span class="ptype">int</span>,
<span class="ptype">short</span>, or <span class="ptype">byte</span>.
It can be the primitive <span class="ptype">char</span> type.  
It can be <span class="classname">String</span>.
Or it can be an enum type (see <a href="../c2/s3.html#basics.3.4">Subsection&nbsp;2.3.4</a> for an introduction to enums).  
In particular, note that the expression <b>cannot</b> be a <span class="ptype">double</span> or 
<span class="ptype">float</span> value.  </p>


<p>The positions within a switch statement to which it
can jump are marked with <span class="newword">case labels</span> that take the form: 
"case&nbsp;<span class="bnf">constant</span>:".  The <span class="bnf">constant</span> here is a literal of
the same type as the expression in the <span class="code">switch</span>.
A case label marks the position the
computer jumps to when the expression evaluates to the given <span class="bnf">constant</span> value. 
You can also use the label "default:" in a <span class="code">switch</span> statement; this provides a default jump point that
is used when the value of the expression is not listed in any case label.</p>


<p>A <span class="code">switch</span> statement, as it is most often used, has the form:</p>


<pre>switch (<span class="bnf">expression</span>) {
   case <span class="bnf">constant-1</span>:
      <span class="bnf">statements-1</span>
      break;
   case <span class="bnf">constant-2</span>:
      <span class="bnf">statements-2</span>
      break;
      .
      .   // (more cases)
      .
   case <span class="bnf">constant-N</span>:
      <span class="bnf">statements-N</span>
      break;
   default:  // optional default case
      <span class="bnf">statements-(N+1)</span>
} // end of switch statement</pre>


<p>This has exactly the same effect as the following multiway <span class="code">if</span> statement,
but the <span class="code">switch</span> statement can be more efficient because the computer
can evaluate one expression and jump directly to the correct case, 
whereas in the <span class="code">if</span> statement, the
computer must evaluate up to <span class="code">N</span> expressions before it knows which set of
statements to execute:</p>


<pre>if (<span class="bnf">expression</span> == <span class="bnf">constant-1</span>) { // but use .equals for String!!
    <span class="bnf">statements-1</span>
} 
else if (<span class="bnf">expression</span> == <span class="bnf">constant-2</span>) { 
    <span class="bnf">statements-2</span>
} 
    .
    .
    .
else if (<span class="bnf">expression</span> == <span class="bnf">constant-N</span>) { 
    <span class="bnf">statements-N</span>
} 
else {
    <span class="bnf">statements-(N+1)</span>
}</pre>


<p>The <span class="code">break</span> statements in the <span class="code">switch</span> are not actually
required by the syntax of the <span class="code">switch</span> statement. The effect of a
<span class="code">break</span> is to make the computer jump past the end of the switch statement,
skipping over all the remaining cases.
If you leave out the break statement, the computer will just forge ahead after
completing one case and will execute the statements associated with the next
case label. This is rarely what you want, but it is legal. (I will note here&mdash;although 
you won't understand it until you get to the next chapter&mdash;that
inside a subroutine, the <span class="code">break</span> statement is sometimes replaced by a
<span class="code">return</span> statement, which terminates the subroutine as well as the switch.)</p>


<p>Note that you can leave out one of the groups of statements entirely
(including the <span class="code">break</span>). You then have two case labels in a row,
containing two different constants. This just means that the computer will jump
to the same place and perform the same action for each of the two
constants.</p>


<p>Here is an example of a switch statement. This is not a useful example, but
it should be easy for you to follow. Note, by the way, that the constants in
the case labels don't have to be in any particular order, but they must
all be different:</p>


<pre>switch ( N ) {   // (Assume N is an integer variable.)
   case 1:
      System.out.println("The number is 1.");
      break;
   case 2:
   case 4:
   case 8:
      System.out.println("The number is 2, 4, or 8.");
      System.out.println("(That's a power of 2!)");
      break;
   case 3:
   case 6:
   case 9:
      System.out.println("The number is 3, 6, or 9.");
      System.out.println("(That's a multiple of 3!)");
      break;
   case 5:
      System.out.println("The number is 5.");
      break;
   default:
      System.out.println("The number is 7 or is outside the range 1 to 9.");
}</pre>

   

<p>The switch statement is pretty primitive as control structures go, and it's
easy to make mistakes when you use it. Java takes all its control structures
directly from the older programming languages C and C++. The switch statement
is certainly one place where the designers of Java should have introduced some
improvements.</p>

<a name="control.6.2">3.6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Menus and switch Statements</a>
</h3>


<p>One application of <span class="code">switch</span> statements is in processing menus. A menu
is a list of options. The user selects one of the options. The computer has to
respond to each possible choice in a different way. If the options are numbered
1, 2,&nbsp;..., then the number of the chosen option can be used in a
<span class="code">switch</span> statement to select the proper response.</p>


<p>In a command-line program, the menu can be presented as a numbered
list of options, and the user can choose an option by typing in its number.
Here is an example that could be used in a variation of the
<span class="code">LengthConverter</span> example from the <a href="../c3/s5.html">previous
section</a>:</p>


<pre>int optionNumber;   // Option number from menu, selected by user.
double measurement; // A numerical measurement, input by the user.
                    //    The unit of measurement depends on which
                    //    option the user has selected.
double inches;      // The same measurement, converted into inches.

/* Display menu and get user's selected option number. */

System.out.println("What unit of measurement does your input use?");
System.out.println();
System.out.println("         1.  inches");
System.out.println("         2.  feet");
System.out.println("         3.  yards");
System.out.println("         4.  miles");
System.out.println();
System.out.println("Enter the number of your choice: ");
optionNumber = TextIO.getlnInt();

/* Read user's measurement and convert to inches. */

switch ( optionNumber ) {
   case 1:
       System.out.println("Enter the number of inches: ");
       measurement = TextIO.getlnDouble();
       inches = measurement;
       break;          
   case 2:
       System.out.println("Enter the number of feet: ");
       measurement = TextIO.getlnDouble();
       inches = measurement * 12;
       break;          
   case 3:
       System.out.println("Enter the number of yards: ");
       measurement = TextIO.getlnDouble();
       inches = measurement * 36;
       break;          
   case 4:
       System.out.println("Enter the number of miles: ");
       measurement = TextIO.getlnDouble();
       inches = measurement * 12 * 5280;
       break;
   default:
       System.out.println("Error!  Illegal option number!  I quit!");
       System.exit(1);          
} // end switch

/* Now go on to convert inches to feet, yards, and miles... */</pre>


<p>This example could instead be written using a <span class="classname">String</span>
in the <span class="code">switch</span> statement:</p>


<pre>String units;       // Unit of measurement, entered by user.
double measurement; // A numerical measurement, input by the user.
double inches;      // The same measurement, converted into inches.

/* Read the user's unit of measurement. */

System.out.println("What unit of measurement does your input use?");
System.out.print("Legal responses: inches, feet, yards, or miles : ");
units = TextIO.getln().toLowerCase();

/* Read user's measurement and convert to inches. */

System.out.print("Enter the number of " + units + ":  ");
measurement = TextIO.getlnDouble();

switch ( units ) {
   case "inches":
       inches = measurement;
       break;          
   case "feet":
       inches = measurement * 12;
       break;          
   case "yards":
       inches = measurement * 36;
       break;          
   case "miles":
       inches = measurement * 12 * 5280;
       break;
   default:
       System.out.println("Wait a minute!  Illegal unit of measure!  I quit!");
       System.exit(1);          
} // end switch</pre>

<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="control.6.3">3.6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Enums in switch Statements</a>
</h3>
   

<p>The type of the expression in a <span class="code">switch</span> can be an enumerated
type.  In that case, the constants in the <span class="code">case</span> labels must
be values from the enumerated type.  For example, suppose that the type of
the expression is the enumerated type <span class="classname">Season</span>
defined by</p>


<pre>enum Season { SPRING, SUMMER, FALL, WINTER }</pre>


<p>and that the expression in a <span class="code">switch</span> statement is an expression
of type <span class="classname">Season</span>.  The constants in the case label must be chosen from among
the values <span class="code">Season.SPRING</span>, <span class="code">Season.SUMMER</span>, <span class="code">Season.FALL</span>, or
<span class="code">Season.WINTER</span>.  However, there is a quirk in the syntax:
when an enum  constant is used in a <span class="code">case</span> label, only the simple name,
such as "<span class="code">SPRING</span>" is used, not the full name, such as "<span class="code">Season.SPRING</span>".
Of course, the computer already knows that the value in the <span class="code">case</span> label
must belong to the enumerated type, since it can tell that from the type of expression
used, so there is really no need to specify the type name in the constant.  For example,
assuming that <span class="code">currentSeason</span> is a variable of type <span class="classname">Season</span>,
then we could have the <span class="code">switch</span> statement:</p>
  

<pre>switch ( currentSeason ) {
   case WINTER:    // ( NOT Season.WINTER ! )
      System.out.println("December, January, February");
      break;
   case SPRING:
      System.out.println("March, April, May");
      break;
   case SUMMER:
      System.out.println("June, July, August");
      break;
   case FALL:
      System.out.println("September, October, November");
      break;
}</pre>



<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="control.6.4">3.6.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Definite Assignment and switch Statements</a>
</h3>
   

<p>As a somewhat more realistic example, the following <span class="code">switch</span> statement
makes a random choice among three possible alternatives.  Recall that the
value of the expression <span class="code">(int)(3*Math.random())</span> is one of the
integers 0, 1, or 2, selected at random with equal probability, so the
<span class="code">switch</span> statement below will assign one of the values
<span class="code">"Rock"</span>, <span class="code">"Paper"</span>, <span class="code">"Scissors"</span> to <span class="code">computerMove</span>,
with probability 1/3 for each case:</p>


<pre>switch ( (int)(3*Math.random()) ) {
   case 0:
      computerMove = "Rock";
      break;
   case 1:
      computerMove = "Paper";
      break;
   case 2:
      computerMove = "Scissors";
      break;
}</pre>


<p>Now, this <span class="code">switch</span> statement is perfectly OK, but suppose that we use it in the
following code segment:</p>
   

<pre>
<span class="newcode">String computerMove;</span>
switch ( (int)(3*Math.random()) ) {
   case 0:
      computerMove = "Rock";
      break;
   case 1:
      computerMove = "Paper";
      break;
   case 2:
      computerMove = "Scissors";
      break;
}
<span class="newcode">System.out.println("The computer's move is " + computerMove);</span>  // ERROR!</pre>


<p>Now there is a subtle error on the last line!  The problem here is due to
definite assignment, the idea that the Java compiler must be able to determine
that a variable has definitely been assigned a value before its value is used.
Definite assignment was introduced in <a href="../c3/s1.html#control.1.4">Subsection&nbsp;3.1.4</a>.
In this example, it's true that the three cases in the <span class="code">switch</span>
cover all the possibilities, but the compiler is not smart enough to figure
that out; it just sees that there is an integer-valued expression in the <span class="code">switch</span>
but not all possible integer values are covered by the given cases.
</p>


<p>A simple solution is to replace the final <span class="code">case</span> in the <span class="code">switch</span>
statement with <span class="code">default</span>.  With a <span class="code">default</span> case, all
possible values of the expression in the <span class="code">switch</span> are certainly covered,
and the compiler knows that <span class="code">computerMove</span> is definitely assigned
a value:</p>


<pre>String computerMove;
switch ( (int)(3*Math.random()) ) {
   case 0:
      computerMove = "Rock";
      break;
   case 1:
      computerMove = "Paper";
      break;
   <span class="newcode">default</span>:
      computerMove = "Scissors";
      break;
}
System.out.println("The computer's move is " + computerMove);  // OK!</pre>
