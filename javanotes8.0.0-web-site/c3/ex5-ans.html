<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 3.5</h2>
<hr class="break">
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 3.5:</h3>
<p>Suppose that a file contains information about sales 
figures for a company in various cities.
Each line of the file contains a city name, followed by a colon&nbsp;(:) followed by the data for that
city.  The data is a number of type <span class="ptype">double.</span>
However, for some cities, no data was available.  In these lines, the data is replaced by
a comment explaining why the data is missing.  For example, several lines from the file might
look like:</p>

<pre>San Francisco:  19887.32
Chicago:  no report received
New York: 298734.12</pre>

<p>Write a program that will compute and print the total sales from all the cities together. The
program should also report the number of cities for which data was not available.  The name of the
file is "sales.dat".</p>

<p>To complete this program, you'll need one fact about file input with <span class="classname">TextIO</span>
that was not covered in <a href="../c2/s4.html#basics.4.4">Subsection&nbsp;2.4.4</a>.  Since you don't know in advance how many
lines there are in the file, you need a way to tell when you have gotten to the end of the file.
When <span class="classname">TextIO</span> is reading from a file, the function <span class="code">TextIO.eof()</span>
can be used to test for <span class="newword">end of file</span>.  This <span class="ptype">boolean</span>-valued
function returns <span class="code">true</span> if the file has been entirely read and returns <span class="code">false</span>
if there is more data to read in the file.  This means that you can read the lines of the
file in a loop <span class="code">while&nbsp;(TextIO.eof()&nbsp;==&nbsp;false)...</span>. The loop will end
when all the lines of the file have been read.</p>

<p>Suggestion:  For each line, read and ignore characters up to the colon.  Then read the rest
of the line into a variable of type <span class="classname">String</span>.  Try to convert the string
into a number, and use <span class="code">try..catch</span> to test whether the conversion succeeds.</p>

<div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr>

<p>The statement <span class="code">TextIO.readFile("sales.dat")</span> can be used at the beginning of
the program to make <span class="classname">TextIO</span> read from the file instead of from the user's input.
This statement throws an <span class="classname">IllegalArgumentException</span> if the file can't be
found.  Although it's not required by the statement of the problem, it would be nice to detect
the exception and print an error message about the missing file.  This can be done as follows,
using <span class="code">System.exit</span> to end the program if the error occurs:</p>
   

<pre>try {
   TextIO.readFile("sales.dat");
}
catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
   System.out.println("Can't open file \"sales.dat\" for reading!");
   System.out.println("Please make sure the file is present before");
   System.out.println("running the program.");
   System.exit(1);  // Terminates the program.
}</pre>
   

<p>We have two main quantities to keep track of in the program:  The total amount of sales and
the number of cities for which data is missing.  These quantities can be represented by
two variables, <span class="code">salesTotal</span> of type <span class="ptype">double</span> and <span class="code">missingCount</span>
of type <span class="ptype">int</span>.  These variables are initialized to zero before processing any data
from the file, and their values are output at the end of the program, after reading the
entire file.</p>
   

<p>The main processing loop of the program is the <span class="code">while</span> loop mentioned in the
statement of the exercise, which begins <span class="code">while&nbsp;(TextIO.eof()&nbsp;==&nbsp;false)</span>.  
(In my program, I've chosen to use the equivalent but more elegant test
<span class="code">while&nbsp;(&nbsp;!&nbsp;TextIO.eof()&nbsp;)</span>; you should try to understand why
this is equivalent&mdash;and why it is more elegant!)  In pseudocode form, we want a loop
that does the following:</p>


<pre>while there are more lines in the file:
   read the name of the city and the colon that follows it
   read the rest of the line into a string
   try to convert the string into a number
      if the conversion succeeds, add the number to the total sales
      otherwise add 1 to the count of missing data</pre>
   

<p>To read past the name of the city, we can simply read characters using
<span class="code">TextIO.getChar()</span> until we get to the colon:</p>
   

<pre>do {  // Read past characters up to the ':'.
   ch = TextIO.getChar();
} while (ch != ':');</pre>
   

<p>where <span class="code">ch</span> is a variable of type <span class="ptype">char</span>.  We can read the rest
of the line using <span class="code">TextIO.getln()</span>.  (As a side note, it's important here
that we read the entire line, including the carriage return at the end.  <span class="code">TextIO.getln()</span>
does this.  If we neglected to read the carriage return at the end of the line,
<span class="code">TextIO.eof()</span> would not detect the end of the file correctly.  After the
data from the last line is read, the carriage return character would still be there in
the file waiting to be read; since there is still something left to read in the file,
<span class="code">TextIO.eof()</span> would be false <span class="code">false</span> and the while loop would
continue, even though all the cities have already been processed.  In fact, the program
would crash while looking for the next&nbsp;':', which is not there.  Text processing
can be surprisingly subtle!)</p>
   

<p>Once we have the information in the form of a <span class="classname">String</span>, we can try to
convert the string into a number with <span class="code">Double.parseDouble</span>.  If the string is
not a number, this will throw an exception of type <span class="classname">NumberFormatException</span>.
We can catch the error in a <span class="code">try..catch</span> statement.  The "missing data"
processing is done in the <span class="code">catch</span> part of this statement.  In the program,
this takes the form:</p>

<pre>try {
   sales = Double.parseDouble(dataString);
   salesTotal += sales;  // This is skipped if the conversion fails.
}
catch (NumberFormatException e) {
       // The dataString is not a number, so it counts as
       // missing data.  Add 1 to the missing data count.
   missingCount++;
}</pre>
   

<p>(Note that my solution assumes that the data file (if it exists at all) has exactly the
format that is specified in the problem.  The problem would be more difficult if we had
to check the format of the file, to see whether it conforms to the specification.)</p>
