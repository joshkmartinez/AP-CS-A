<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 3.9:</h3>
<p>Often, some element of an animation repeats over and over, every so many frames.
Sometimes, the repetition is "cyclic,"  meaning that at the end it jumps back to the start.
Sometimes the repetition is "oscillating," like a back-and-forth motion where the second
half is the same as the first half played in reverse.</p>

<p>Write an animation that demonstrates both cyclic and oscillating motions at various speeds.
For cyclic motion, you can use a square that moves across the drawing area, then jumps back to
the start, and then repeats the same motion over and over.  For oscillating motion, you can do something
similar, but the square should move back and forth between the two edges of the drawing area; that is,
it moves left-to-right during the first half of the animation and then backwards from right-to-left
during the second half.  To write the program, you can start with a copy of
the sample program <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter3/SimpleAnimationStarter.java">SimpleAnimationStarter.java</a></span>.</p>

<p>A cyclic motion has to repeat every N frames for some value of N.  What you draw in some
frame of the animation depends on the <span class="code">frameNumber</span>.  The <span class="code">frameNumber</span> just keeps
increasing forever.  To implement cyclic motion, what you really want is a "cyclic frame number" that
takes on the values 0, 1, 2, ..., (N-1), 0, 1, 2, ..., (N-1), 0, 1, 2, ....  You can derive
the value that you need from <span class="code">frameNumber</span> simply by saying</p>

<pre>cyclicFrameNumber = frameNumber % N;</pre>

<p>Then, you just have to base what you draw on <span class="code">cyclicFrameNumber</span> instead of on
<span class="code">frameNumber</span>.  Similarly, for an oscillating animation, you need an
"oscillation frame number" that takes on the values  0, 1, 2, ... (N-1), N, (N-1), (N-2), ... 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 
and so on, repeating the back and forth motion forever.  You can compute the value that you need with</p>

<pre>oscilationFrameNumber = frameNumber % (2*N);
if (oscillationFrameNumber &gt; N)
   oscillationFrameNumber = (2*N) - oscillationFrameNumber;</pre>

<p>Here is a screen shot from my version of the program.  I use
six squares.  The top three do cyclic motion at various speeds, while the bottom three do
oscillating motion.  I drew black lines across the drawing area to separate the squares and to give
them "channels" to move in.

<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr>

<p>This exercise exists mostly to introduce you to cyclic and oscillating motion and the formulas
that are used to implement them.  But it's also a good exercise in designing an animation
and working with coordinates.</p>

<p>Some decisions have to be made before you can start writing code.  I decided to use
rather small squares.  (Actually, I tried it with big squares and didn't like the appearance
as much.)  The size of my squares is 20-by-20 pixels.  For my first cyclic motion, I decided 
to make the length of the frame 300 frames, or about 5 seconds.  This means that 
<span class="code">cyclicFrameNumber</span> can be computed as <span class="code">frameNumber&nbsp;%&nbsp;300</span>.
And I decided to move the
square at one pixel per frame; that lets me use <span class="code">cyclicFrameNumber</span> as
the x-coordinate for the square.  The top square moves along the top edge of the
window, so its y-coordinate is 0.  The code for the first square is:</p>

<pre>cyclicFrameNum = frameNumber % 300;  // Repeats every 300 frames
g.setFill(Color.RED);
g.fillRect( cyclicFrameNum, 0, 20, 20 );</pre>

<p>The exercise asks for cyclic motion at different speeds.  If the second square
is to be faster than the first, it should cross the drawing area in a smaller
number of frames.  If it is twice as fast, it will only need half as many frames to
make it across the drawing area.  For the second square, I use a cycle length of 150
instead of 300.  To cross the entire area, the x-coordinate of the square must
get to 300 after just 150 frames.  We can accomplish that by using
<span class="code">2*cyclicFrameNumber</span> as the x-coord.  (Another way to think about it:
A square with x-coord <span class="code">2*cyclicFrameNumber</span> moves twice as fast as
one with x-coord <span class="code">cyclicFrameNumber</span>.  And it will finish the journey after
150 frames instead of 300, so the length of the cycle should be 150 frames.)  The
code for the second square is</p>

<pre>cyclicFrameNum = frameNumber % 150;  // Repeats every 150 frames
g.setColor(Color.GREEN);
g.fillRect( 2*cyclicFrameNum, 20, 20, 20 );</pre>

<p>The y-coord is 20, since the top square occupies 20 pixels at top of the window.
The third square moves three times as fast as the first, and its code is similar.</p>

<p>For the fourth square, I want an oscillating motion.  Like the first square, it takes
300 frames to move across the window from left to right.  But then it takes another
300 frames to move back from right to left.  The total length of the motion is 600.
(In the formula given in the exercise, N is 300 and 2*N is 600.)  The formula for the
oscillation frame number is</p>

<pre>oscilationFrameNum = frameNumber % 600;
if (oscilationFrameNum &gt; 300)
    oscilationFrameNum = 600 - oscilationFrameNum;</pre>

<p>You should study how this works.  When <span class="code">oscilationFrameNumber</span> is between
300 and 600, the formula <span class="code">600-oscilationFrameNumber</span> gives an answer between
0 and 300.  And as <span class="code">oscilationFrameNumber</span> gets bigger, 
<span class="code">600-oscilationFrameNumber</span> gets smaller (which will mean that the x-coord
of the square is decreasing).  From there, you should be able to figure out the
rest of the program.</p>

<p>One more small issue is the size of the drawing area.  Since there are 6 squares,
and each is 20 pixels high, the height of the drawing area must be 120.
You might think at first that the width should be 300, since the x-coordinate of
the square goes up to 300.  But that x-coordinate is actually where the left edge
of the square is.  When the left edge is at 300, the right edge is at 320.  So for the
entire square to be visible, we have to make the width 320.</p>

<p>For drawing the horizontal black lines, the program uses the statement</p>

<pre>g.strokeLine(0,y+0.5,320,y+0.5);</pre>

<p>(I should explain the "+ 0.5".  The coordinates in <span class="code">g.strokeLine()</span> give
the position of the <b>centers</b> of the endpoints of the line.  Without the "+&nbsp;"0.5", 
the top half of the line drawn here would lie in one row of pixels, and the bottom half
would lie in the next row.  The pixels in each row are only half covered by the line!
The computer might, depending on the environment, color a partially covered pixel by blending the drawing color with the
color of the background, so in this case, we would actually get a two pixel wide gray 
line instead of a one pixel wide black line.  This is an example of something called
"antialiasing," which you will encounter again later in the text.  By moving the line down 0.5 pixels, it
will exactly cover one row of pixels, which will be filled with solid black.)
