<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 3.8</h2>

<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 3.8:</h3>
<p>Write a GUI program that draws
a checkerboard.  Base your solution on the sample program
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter3/SimpleGraphicsStarter.java">SimpleGraphicsStarter.java</a></span>  You will draw
the checkerboard in the <span class="code">drawPicture()</span> subroutine, after
erasing the code that it already contains.</p>


<p>The checkerboard should be 400-by-400  pixels.  You can change the size of
the drawing area in <span class="code">SimpleGraphicsStarter.java</span> by modifying the
first two lines of the <span class="code">start()</span> subroutine to set <span class="code">width</span>
and <span class="code">height</span> to 400 instead of 800 and 600.  A checkerboard
contains 8 rows and 8 columns of squares.  If the size of the drawing area is 400,
that means that each square should be 50-by-50 pixels.  
The squares are red and black (or whatever other colors you choose). Here is a tricky way
to determine whether a given square should be red or black: The rows and columns can be
thought of as numbered from 0 to 7.  If the row number of the square and the
column number of the square are either both even or both odd, then the square is red.
Otherwise, it is black. Note that a square is just a rectangle in which the
height is equal to the width, so you can use the subroutine
<span class="code">g.fillRect()</span> to draw the squares. Here is a reduced-size image of the
checkerboard that you want to draw:</p>

<p>The basic algorithm is obvious:</p>


<pre>for each row of the checkerboard:
    Draw all the squares in that row</pre>


<p>Since any given row contains eight squares, one in each column of the
checkerboard, we can expand the body of the for loop into another for loop:</p>


<pre>for each of the eight rows of the checkerboard:
    for each of the eight columns:
        Draw the square in that row and column</pre>


<p>Each square is a rectangle with height 50 and width 50, so it can be drawn
with the command <span class="code">g.fillRect(x,y,50,50)</span>, where <span class="code">x</span> and
<span class="code">y</span> are the coordinates of the top-left corner of the square. Before
drawing the square, we have to determine whether it should be red or black, and
we have to set the correct color with <span class="code">g.setColor</span>. So, the algorithm
becomes</p>


<pre>for each row on the checkerboard:
    for each of the eight columns:
        Compute x,y for the top-left corner of the square
        if it's a red square:
           g.setFill(Color.RED)
        else
           g.setFill(Color.BLACK)
        g.fillRect(x,y,50,50)</pre>


<p>The top of the first row of squares is at <span class="code">y=0</span>. Since each square is
50 pixels high, the top of the second row is at <span class="code">y=50</span>, followed by 100
for the third row, then 150, 200, 250, 300, and 350. If we assume that the rows
are numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., 7, then the tops are given by <span class="code">y&nbsp;=&nbsp;row*50</span>,
where <span class="code">row</span> is the row number. (If you number the rows 1, 2, ..., 8, the
formula would be <span class="code">(row-1)*20</span>. The simpler formula in this and in many
similar cases is one reason why computer scientists like to start counting with
0 instead of 1.) Similarly, the left edge of the squares in column <span class="code">col</span>
is given by <span class="code">x&nbsp;=&nbsp;col*50</span>, where again the columns are numbered 0, 1, 2,
..., 7. I'll use "<span class="code">for&nbsp;(row=0;&nbsp;row&lt;8;&nbsp;row++)</span>" to count off the rows,
rather than the equivalent "<span class="code">for (row=0;&nbsp;row&lt;=7;&nbsp;row++)</span>". The 8
reminds me that I am counting off the <b>eight</b> numbers 0, 1, 2,
..., 7. Again, this is typical computer science style.</p>


<p>The only problem remaining is how to determine whether the square is red. As
noted in the exercise, a square is red if <span class="code">row</span> and <span class="code">col</span> are
either both even or both odd. Since an integer <span class="code">N</span> is even if
<span class="code">N%2</span> is 0, the test could be expressed as</p>


<pre>if ((row%2 == 0 &amp;&amp; col%2 == 0) || (row%2 == 1 &amp;&amp; col%2 == 1))</pre>


<p>However,
note that this is the same as asking whether <span class="code">row%2</span> and <span class="code">col%2</span>
have the same value. So the test can be written more simply as 
"<span class="code">if&nbsp;(row%2&nbsp;==&nbsp;col%2)</span>". Putting this all together into syntactically correct Java
code, the algorithm becomes</p>


<pre>for ( row = 0;  row &lt; 8;  row++ ) {
   for ( col = 0;  col &lt; 8;  col++ ) {
       x = 50*col;
       y = 50*row;
       if ( (row % 2) == (col % 2) )
          g.setFill(Color.RED);
       else
          g.setFill(Color.BLACK);
       g.fillRect(x,y,50,50);
   }
}</pre>


<p>Of course, the variables <span class="code">row</span>, <span class="code">col</span>, <span class="code">x</span>, and
<span class="code">y</span> have to be declared to be of type <span class="ptype">int</span>. Then, the code goes
into the body of the <span class="code">drawPicture()</span>subroutine.</p>


<p>The complete program is shown below.  In the original program, the size of the
drawing area was 800-by-600.  As noted in a comment, to change the size to
400-by-400, I had to change the first two lines in the main routine, replacing 800 and
600 by 400.  And I changed the title of the window to "Checkerboard" in another
line in <span class="code">main()</span>.</p>


<p>I also changed the name of the class from
<span class="classname">SimpleGraphicsStarter</span> to <span class="classname">Checkerboard</span>.
Remember that this also requires changing the name of the file from
<span class="code">SimpleGraphicsStarter.java</span> to <span class="code">Checkerboard.java</span>.
