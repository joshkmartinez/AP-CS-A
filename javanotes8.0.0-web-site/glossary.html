<hr class="break">

<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">abstract class.</span>&nbsp;
    <span class="glossary_definition">A class that cannot be used to create objects, and that
exists only for the purpose of creating subclasses.  Abstract classes in Java are
defined using the modifier <span class="code">abstract</span>.</span>
</p>

<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">abstract data type (ADT).</span>&nbsp;
    <span class="glossary_definition">A data type for which the possible values of the type
and the permissible operations on those values are specified, without specifying how
the values and operations are to be implemented.</span>
</p>

<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">access specifier.</span>&nbsp;
    <span class="glossary_definition">A modifier used on a method definition or variable
specification that determines what classes can use that method or variable.
The access specifiers in Java are <span class="code">public</span>, <span class="code">protected</span>, and
<span class="code">private</span>.  A method or variable that has no access specifier is said
to have "package" visibility.</span>
</p>

<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">activation record.</span>&nbsp;
    <span class="glossary_definition">A data structure that contains all the information 
necessary to implement a subroutine call, including the values of parameters and local
variables of the subroutine and the return address to which the computer will return
when the subroutine ends.  Activation records are stored on a stack, which makes it
possible for several subroutine calls to be active at the same time.  This is particularly
important for recursion, where several calls to the same subroutine can be active
at the same time.</span>
</p>

<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">actual parameter.</span>&nbsp;
    <span class="glossary_definition">A parameter in a subroutine call statement, whose value
will be passed to the subroutine when the call statement is executed.  Actual parameters
are also called "arguments".</span>
</p>

<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">address.</span>&nbsp;
    <span class="glossary_definition">Each location in the computer's memory has an address, which is
a number that identifies that location.  Locations in memory are numbered sequentially.
In modern computers, each byte of memory has its own address.
Addresses are used when information is being stored into or retrieved from memory.</span>
</p>

<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">algorithm.</span>&nbsp;
    <span class="glossary_definition">An unambiguous, step-by-step procedure for performing some task,

<span class="glossary_term">alpha color component.</span>&nbsp;
    <span class="glossary_definition">A component of a color that says how transparent or opaque

objects; a new frame of the animation is shown each time the timer fires. </span>
</p>

<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">antialiasing.</span>&nbsp;
    <span class="glossary_definition">Adjusting the color of pixels to reduce the "jagged" effect
that can occur when shapes and text are represented by pixels.  For antialiased drawing,
when the shape covers only part of a pixel, the color of the shape is blended with the
previous color of the pixel.  The degree of blending depends on how much of the pixel
is covered.</span>
</p>

<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">array.</span>&nbsp;
    <span class="glossary_definition">A list of items, sequentially numbered.  Each item in the list can be
identified by its index, that is, its sequence number.  In Java, all the items in 
array must have the same type, called the base type of the array.  An array
is a random access data structure; that is, you can get directly at any item
in the array at any time.</span>
</p>

<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">array type.</span>&nbsp;

only supports 128 characters, with no accented letters, non-English alphabets, special symbols,

more complete Unicode code for characters.</span>
</p>

into a single statement.  A block can also be empty, meaning that it contains no statements
at all and consists of just an empty pair of braces.</span>
</p>

<span class="glossary_term">blocking operation.</span>&nbsp;
    <span class="glossary_definition">An operation, such as reading data from a network connection,
is said to "block" if it has to wait for some event to occur.  A thread that performs a blocking
operation can be "blocked" until the required event occurs.  A thread cannot execute any
instructions while it is blocked.  Other threads in the same program, however, can continue
to run.</span>
</p>

</p>

<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">class.</span>&nbsp;
    <span class="glossary_definition">The basic unit of programming in Java.  A class is a collection

<span class="glossary_term">type cast.</span>&nbsp;
    <span class="glossary_definition">Forces the conversion of a value of one type into another type.

to the variable, in a variable declaration
statement.  The name can then be used in that program to refer to the memory
location, or to the data stored in that memory location, depending on context.  
In Java, a variable has a <i>type</i>, which specifies what kind of data it can hold.</span>
