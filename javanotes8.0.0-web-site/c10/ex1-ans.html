<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 10.1:</h3>
<p>Rewrite the <span class="classname">PhoneDirectory</span> class
from <a href="../c7/s4.html#arrays.4.2">Subsection&nbsp;7.4.2</a> so that it uses a <span class="classname">TreeMap</span>
to store directory entries, instead of an array.  (Doing this was suggested
in <a href="../c10/s3.html#generics.3.1">Subsection&nbsp;10.3.1</a>.)  You should also write a short program
to test the class.</p>

<p>The class that you are asked to write for this exercise
really is very trivial.  Everything that the class needs to do is already done
by the <span class="classname">TreeMap</span> class, and <span class="classname">TreeMap</span>
does much more besides.  In fact the only reason to write the <span class="classname">PhoneDirectory</span>
class is to <b>hide</b> a lot of the capabilities of <span class="classname">TreeMaps</span>.
A <span class="classname">PhoneDirectory</span> object is a "thin wrapper" around a <span class="classname">TreeMap</span>
object.  It allows only the operations <span class="code">getNumber(name)</span> and
<span class="code">putNumber(name,number)</span>.  Each of these can be implemented in a single line,
as a call to one of the methods in the <span class="classname">TreeMap</span>.  The
<span class="classname">PhoneDirectory</span> does provide nice, meaningful names
for the methods, and it adds a check to the implementation of <span class="code">putNumber(name,number)</span>
to ensure that <span class="code">name</span> and <span class="code">number</span> are not <span class="code">null</span>.</p>

<p>It would be nice for phone directories to have a few more capabilities.  A method for
listing the contents of the directory would be especially nice, so I have added one
to my class even though there was no such method in the original <span class="classname">PhoneDirectory</span>
class.  The print method uses a for-each loop to iterate through the entry set of
the phone directory. It is very similar to examples in <a href="../c10/s3.html#generics.3.2">Subsection&nbsp;10.3.2</a>
Even with this addition, though, the <span class="classname">PhoneDirectory</span> class is
still very far from being useful in real applications.</p>

<pre class="exercisecode">import java.util.Map;
import java.util.TreeMap;

/**
 * A phone directory holds a list of names with a phone number for

 */
public class PhoneDirectoryWithTreeMap {


/**

   public PhoneDirectoryWithTreeMap() {
      data = new TreeMap&lt;String,String&gt;();
   }
   
   
   /**
    * Finds the phone number, if any, for a given name.

   public String getNumber( String name ) {
         return data.get(name);
   }

   
   /**
    * Associates a given name with a given phone number.  If the name
    * already exists in the phone directory, then the new number replaces
    * the old one.  Otherwise, a new name/number pair is added.  The

    */
   public void putNumber( String name, String number ) {
      if (name == null || number == null)
          throw new IllegalArgumentException("name and number cannot be null");
      data.put(name,number);
   }
   
   
   /**
    *  Write the contents of the phone directory to System.out.
    */
   public void print() {
      for ( Map.Entry&lt;String,String&gt; entry : data.entrySet() )
         System.out.println( entry.getKey() + ":  " + entry.getValue() );
   }

} // end class PhoneDirectoryWithTreeMap

</pre>


<p>Here is a very small program to test the class:</p>


<pre class="exercisecode">
public class TestPhoneDirectoryWithTreeMap {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
       PhoneDirectoryWithTreeMap directory = new PhoneDirectoryWithTreeMap();
       System.out.println("This program creates a PhoneDirectoryWithTreeMap and");
       System.out.println("adds several entries.  It then prints the contents of");
       System.out.println("directory and does a few lookups.");
       System.out.println();
       directory.putNumber("Fred","555-1234");
       directory.putNumber("Barney","555-2345");
       directory.putNumber("Wilma","555-3456");
       System.out.println("Contents are:");
       System.out.println();
       directory.print();
       System.out.println();
       System.out.println("Number for Fred is " + directory.getNumber("Fred"));
       System.out.println("Number for Wilma is " + directory.getNumber("Wilma"));
       System.out.println("Number for Tom is " + directory.getNumber("Tom"));
          // The output from the last line should be null.
   }

}
