<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 10.2</h2>
<hr class="break">
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 10.2:</h3>
<p>In mathematics, several
operations are defined on sets. The <span class="newword">union</span> of two
sets A and B is a set that contains all the elements that are in A together
with all the elements that are in B. The <span class="newword">intersection</span> 
of A and B is the set that contains elements that
are in both A and B. The <span class="newword">difference</span> of A and B is
the set that contains all the elements of A <b>except</b> for those elements
that are also in&nbsp;B.</p>


<p>Suppose that <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> are variables of type <span class="code">set</span> in
Java. The mathematical operations on <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> can be computed
using methods from the <span class="classname">Set</span> interface. In particular: 
<span class="code">A.addAll(B)</span> computes the <i>union</i> of <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span>;
<span class="code">A.retainAll(B)</span> computes the <i>intersection</i> of <span class="code">A</span> and
<span class="code">B</span>; and <span class="code">A.removeAll(B)</span> computes the <i>difference</i> of <span class="code">A</span>
and <span class="code">B</span>. (These operations change the contents of the set <span class="code">A</span>,
while the mathematical operations create a new set without changing <span class="code">A</span>,
but that difference is not relevant to this exercise.)</p>


<p>For this exercise, you should write a program that can be used as a "set
calculator" for simple operations on sets of non-negative integers. (Negative
integers are not allowed.) For input and output, a set of such integers will be written as a list
of integers, separated by commas and, optionally, spaces and enclosed in square
brackets. For example: <span class="code">[1,2,3]</span> or
<span class="code">[17,&nbsp;42,&nbsp;9,&nbsp;53,&nbsp;108]</span>. The characters <span class="code">+</span>,
<span class="code">*</span>, and <span class="code">-</span> will be used for the union, intersection, and
difference operations. The user of the program will type in lines of input
containing two sets, separated by an operator. The program should perform the
operation and print the resulting set. Here are some examples:</p>


<pre>          Input                                 Output
         -------------------------           -------------------
          [1, 2, 3] + [3,  5,  7]             [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
          [10,9,8,7] * [2,4,6,8]              [8]
          [ 5, 10, 15, 20 ] - [ 0, 10, 20 ]   [5, 15]</pre>


<p>To represent sets of non-negative integers, use 
sets of type <span class="classname">TreeSet&lt;Integer&gt;</span>. Read the user's input,
create two <span class="classname">TreeSets</span>, and use the appropriate <span class="classname">TreeSet</span> method
to perform the requested operation on the two sets. Your program should be able
to read and process any number of lines of input. If a line contains a syntax
error, your program should not crash. It should report the error and move on to
the next line of input. (Note: To print out a <span class="classname">Set</span>, <span class="code">A</span>, of
<span class="classname">Integers</span>, you can just say <span class="code">System.out.print(A)</span>. I've chosen
the syntax for sets to be the same as that used by the system for outputting a
set.)</p>

<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr>
<p>This program would be <b>much</b> easier to write if we could assume that
the user's input was in the correct format. Unfortunately, the exercise says
that we have to detect errors in the user's input and handle them by printing
error messages. To do this we have to constantly look ahead while reading the
user's input, to see whether the input agrees with what we are expecting. The
techniques for doing this were covered for the example 
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter8/LengthConverter2.java">LengthConverter2.java</a></span> from <a href="../c8/s2.html#robustness.2.2">Subsection&nbsp;8.2.2</a>.
We can use the function <span class="code">TextIO.peek()</span>
to look ahead at the next character in the user's input. We need to be able
to skip past any blanks in the input.  Instead of writing my own method to do
that, I use the method <span class="code">TextIO.skipBlanks()</span> in my program.</p>



<p>My program uses exceptions to handle
the errors. Exceptions make it possible to organize the error-handling code in
a straightforward way. When an error is discovered, an exception is thrown. The
main program uses a <span class="code">try..catch</span> statement to try to process one line
of input. If an error occurs, the program does not crash. The error is caught,
an error message is printed, and the program continues. I throw an error of
type <span class="classname">IllegalArgumentException</span> when an error is found. This exception
is a standard part of Java, but it might be better style to define a new error
class to represent the specific type of error that occurs in this program.</p>


<p>My program uses a method named <span class="code">calc()</span> to read and process one line
of input. This method in turn uses another method, <span class="code">readSet()</span> to read
each of the two sets of integers from the input line. Without error handling,
an algorithm for <span class="code">readSet()</span> would be:</p>


<pre>Start with an empty set.
Read the '[' that begins the set.
Repeat:
   Read the next number and add it to the set.
   If the next character is ']':
      break.
   Read the comma that separates one number from the next.
Read the ']'.
Return the set.</pre>


<p>To turn this into a robust routine, we just have to check, before reading
anything, that the next character is legal. If not, throw an exception. This
adds a lot of code, but the nice thing about throwing exceptions is that it
doesn't disturb the logical flow of the routine.</p>


<p>There is one possible bug in the algorithm as given. It assumes that there is at
least one number in the set. But in mathematics, a set can be empty. I decided
to allow for the possibility of empty sets in my program. See the solution,
below.</p>


<p>An algorithm for the <span class="code">calc()</span> method is even more straightforward.
Again, the basic algorithm ignores the possibility of errors:</p>


<pre>Read the first set, A.
Read the operator.
Read the second set, B.
if the operator is '+'
   A.addAll(B)  // Sets A equal to the union of A and B.
else if the operator is '*'
   A.retainAll(B)  // Sets A to the intersection.
else
   A.removeAll(B)  // Sets A to the difference.
Print A.</pre>


<p>In the program, an error check has to be added to make sure that there is a legal operator
in the correct position. I also add an error check to make sure that there is
no extra data on the line.</p>
