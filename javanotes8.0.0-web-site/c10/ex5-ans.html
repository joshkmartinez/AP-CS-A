<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 10.5</h2>

<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 10.5:</h3>
<p>This is a short exercise in using the stream API. 
Suppose that the class <span class="classname">Score</span> is defined as</p>


<pre>class ScoreInfo {
    String firstName;
    String lastName;
    int score;
    Score( String lName, String fName, int s ) {
        firstName = fName;
        lastName = lName;
        score = s;
    }
}</pre>


<p>and that <span class="code">scoreData</span> is an array of <span class="classname">ScoreInfos</span>
containing information about the scores of students on a test.
Use the stream API to do each of the following tasks:</p>

<ul>

<li>print the number of students (without using <span class="code">scoreData.length</span>)</li>

<li>print the average score for all of the students</li>

<li>print the number of students who got an A (score greater than or equal to 90)</li>

<li>use the <span class="code">collect()</span> stream operation to create 
    a <span class="classname">List&lt;String&gt;</span> that contains the names of students whose score was less than 70;
    the names should be in the form first name followed by last name</li>

<li>print the names from the <span class="classname">List</span> that was generated in the previous task</li>

<li>print out the student's names and scores, ordered last name</li>

<li>print out the student's names and scores, ordered by score</li>

</ul>

<p>You can put all of the code in <span class="code">main()</span> routine and include
<span class="classname">ScoreInfo</span> as a <span class="code">static</span> nested class.
Do not use <b>any</b> for loops or other control structures.  Do everything
using the stream API.  For testing your code, you can use this array:</p>


<pre>private static ScoreInfo[] scoreData = new ScoreInfo[] {
        new Score("Smith","John",70),
        new Score("Doe","Mary",85),
        new Score("Page","Alice",82),
        new Score("Cooper","Jill",97),
        new Score("Flintstone","Fred",66),
        new Score("Rubble","Barney",80),
        new Score("Smith","Judy",48),
        new Score("Dean","James",90),
        new Score("Russ","Joe",55),
        new Score("Wolfe","Bill",73),
        new Score("Dart","Mary",54),
        new Score("Rogers","Chris",78),
        new Score("Toole","Pat",51),
        new Score("Khan","Omar",93),
        new Score("Smith","Ann",95)
};</pre>

<p>In each case, to process the values from the array using the stream 
API, we need to make a stream containing those values.  That's done by calling
<span class="code">Arrays.stream(scoreData)</span>.  From there, we just need to apply the
appropriate stream operators to get the desired results.  I have added some
comments on each of the assigned tasks to the program.</p>
