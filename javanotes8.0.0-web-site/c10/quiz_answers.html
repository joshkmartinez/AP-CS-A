<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> sample answers to the quiz on Chapter 10 of
           <a href="../index.html"><i>Introduction to Programming Using Java</i></a>.
           Note that generally, there are lots of correct answers to a given question.</p>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;1:</p>
<p>What is meant by <i>generic
programming</i> and what is the alternative?</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>Generic programming means
writing data structures and subroutines that can be used for many different
types of data. The alternative would be to write a new data structure or
subroutine for each different type of data, even when they would all be
essentially identical except for the type name. For example, a single generic
sort routine can be used for sorting lists that contain data of any type.
The alternative is one routine for sorting lists of integers, one for sorting
lists of strings, one for storing arrays of real numbers, and so on.</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;2:</p>
<p>Why can't you make an object of type <span class="classname">LinkedList&lt;int&gt;</span>?
What should you do instead?</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>
<span class="classname">LinkedList&lt;int&gt;</span> is an attempt to use a generic
class with a type parameter of type <span class="ptype">int</span>, which is a primitive type.
Generic programming in Java works only for objects, and not for the primitive types,
so a type parameter of primitive type is not allowed.  However, it is possible
to use the wrapper class <span class="classname">Integer</span> in place of <span class="ptype">int</span>.
An object of type <span class="classname">LinkedList&lt;Integer&gt;</span> can be used almost
as if it were actually a list of <span class="ptype">ints</span>.</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;3:</p>
<p>What is an <i>iterator</i>
and why are iterators necessary for generic programming?</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>One of the principle features of
Java's generic programming framework is <span class="classname">Collections</span>. There are several types of
collection (including <span class="classname">LinkedList</span>, <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>, 
<span class="classname">TreeSet</span>, and <span class="classname">HashSet</span>). In order
to deal with all the different types of collection in a generic way, we need a
generic way to access all the elements in a collection. An iterator makes this
possible. An iterator is an object associated with a collection that makes it
possible to traverse the collection (that is, to visit each of the items in the
collection in turn). Code written using iterators will work for any type of
collection.  (Note, however, that explicit use of an iterator can often be
avoided by using a for-each loop.)</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;4:</p>
<p>Suppose that
<span class="code">integers</span> is a variable of type <span class="classname">Collection&lt;Integer&gt;</span>.
Write a code segment that uses an iterator to compute the sum of all the integer values in 
the collection.  Write a second code segment that does the same thing using a
for-each loop.</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>Using an iterator:</p>

<pre>int sum = 0;
Iterator&lt;Integer&gt;  iter = integers.iterator();
while ( iter.hasNext() ) {
   sum += iter.next();
}</pre>

<p>The statement "<span class="code">sum += iter.next()</span>" relies on the automatic conversion
from type <span class="classname">Integer</span> to type <span class="ptype">int</span>.  It could
also be written "<span class="code">sum += iter.next().intValue()</span>".</p>

<p>Using a for-each loop:</p>

<pre>int sum = 0;
for ( int number : integers ) {   // ( Could also use "Integer number : integers". )
   sum += number;
}</pre>

<p>Note that either of these two solutions will fail if <span class="code">integers</span>
contains a <span class="code">null</span> value.</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;5:</p>
<p>Interfaces such as
<span class="classname">List</span>, <span class="classname">Set</span>, and <span class="classname">Map</span> 
define <i>abstract data types.</i> Explain what this means.</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>An abstract data type is defined
by the operations that can be performed on it, not by the way the data is
actually stored or by the way the operations are implemented. An interface such
as <span class="classname">List</span> defines operations that can be performed, but says nothing
about how they are to be implemented. In fact, there can be many different
implementations. For example, both <span class="classname">LinkedList</span> and <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>
implement the <span class="classname">List</span> interface. They are different "concrete" data types
that implement the same abstract data type.</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;6:</p>
<p>What is the fundamental
property that distinguishes <span class="classname">Sets</span> from other types of
<span class="classname">Collections</span>?</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>A <span class="classname">Set</span> cannot contain
duplicate elements.  Adding an item to the
set has no effect if that item is already in the set.  (Note that exactly what it means to say that two
items are the same depends on the type of set.  For <span class="classname">HashSet</span>,
two items are tested for equality using the <span class="code">equals()</span> method.
For a <span class="classname">TreeSet</span>, the test for equality uses the
<span class="code">compareTo()</span> method from the <span class="classname">Comparable</span> interface
or the <span class="code">compare()</span> method from a <span class="classname">Comparator</span>.)</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;7:</p>
<p>What is the essential
difference in functionality between a <span class="classname">TreeMap</span> and a
<span class="classname">HashMap</span>?</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>The key/value pairs in a
<span class="classname">TreeMap</span> are sorted so that the keys are in ascending order. (For this
reason, it must be possible to compare the keys in a <span class="classname">TreeMap</span>, using
a <span class="code">compareTo()</span> method or <span class="code">compare()</span>.  Either the keys must implement the
<span class="classname">Comparable</span> interface or a <span class="classname">Comparator</span> must
be provided to do the comparison.)</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;8:</p>
<p>Explain what is meant by a <i>hash code.</i>
</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>The hash code of an object is an
integer that tells where that object should be stored in a hash table. A hash
table is an array of linked lists. When an object is stored in a hash table, it
is added to one of these linked lists. The object's hash code is the index of
the position in the array where the object is stored. All objects with the same
hash code go into the same linked list.  In Java, every object <span class="code">obj</span> has a method
<span class="code">obj.hashCode()</span> that is used to compute hash codes for the object.
If the object is to be stored in a hash table of size <span class="code">N</span>, then
the hash code that is used for the object is <span class="code">Math.abs(obj.hashCode())%N</span>.</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;9:</p>
<p>Modify the following
<span class="classname">Date</span> class so that it implements the interface <span class="classname">Comparable&lt;Date&gt;</span>.
The ordering on objects of type <span class="classname">Date</span> should be the natural,
chronological ordering.</p>

<pre>class Date {
   int month;  // Month number in range 1 to 12.
   int day;    // Day number in range 1 to 31.
   int year;   // Year number.
   Date(int m, int d, int y) { 
      month = m;
      day = d;
      year = y;
   }
}</pre>

</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>The interface <span class="classname">Comparable&lt;Date&gt;</span> specifies the method
<span class="code">"public int compareTo(Date d)"</span>, which will be used to compare
two objects of type <span class="classname">Date</span>. The
<span class="code">compareTo()</span> method 
must be added to the class, and the class must be declared to implement the
interface. To compare two dates, first try comparing the
years. If the years are equal, try comparing the months. If the months are also
equal, compare the days.</p>

<pre>class Date implements Comparable&lt;Date&gt; {
   int month;  // Month number in range 1 to 12.
   int day;    // Day number in range 1 to 31.
   int year;   // Year number.
   Date(int m, int d, int y) {
      month = m;
      day = d;
      year = y;
   }
   public int compareTo( Date otherDate ) {
           // Returns 1, 0, or -1 if this date is greater than, equal to,
           // or less than otherDate, respectively.
      if (year &lt; otherDate.year)
         return -1;
      else if (year &gt; otherDate.year)
         return 1;
      else { // Years are equal; compare months.
         if (month &lt; otherDate.month)
            return -1;
         else if (month &gt; otherDate.month)
            return 1;
         else { // Years and months are equal; compare days.
            if (day &lt; otherDate.day)
               return -1;
            else if (day &gt; otherDate.day)
               return 1;
            else 
               return 0;
         }
      }
   }
}</pre>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;10:</p>
<p>Suppose that
<span class="code">syllabus</span> is a variable of type <span class="classname">TreeMap&lt;Date,String&gt;</span>,
where <span class="classname">Date</span> is the class from the preceding exercise.
Write a code segment that will write
out the value string for every key that is in the month of December, 2018.</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>I will give two solutions. One
of them simply looks up each date in December, 2018 in the map and prints the
corresponding value, if there is one. The other iterates though a submap that
contains all the entries for dates in that month.</p>

<pre>
A solution using the map's get() method:

      for (int day = 1; day &lt;= 31; day++) {
           // Get the info for one day in December, 2018
         Date date = new Date(12,day,2018); // The key.
         String info = syllabus.get(date);  // Get the value for that key.
                                            // (Can be null if there is no
                                            // entry in the map for this date.)
         if (info != null)
            System.out.println("December " + day + ": " + info);
      }


A solution using a submap (harder, but more efficient):

      Date startDate = new Date(12,1,2018); // Starting date for submap.
      Date endDate = new Date(1,1,2019);    // Ending date for submap.
                                            // (Remember that the end date
                                            // is not included.)
      Map&lt;Date,String&gt; decemberData = syllabus.subMap(startDate, endDate);
      for ( Map.Entry&lt;Date,String&gt; entry : decemberData ) {
         Date date = entry.getKey();
         String info = entry.getValue();
         System.out.println("December " + date.day + ": " + info);
      }</pre>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;11:</p>
<p>Write a generic class <span class="classname">Stack&lt;T&gt;</span> that can be
used to represent stacks of objects of type <span class="classname">T</span>.  The class
should include methods <span class="code">push()</span>, <span class="code">pop()</span>, and
<span class="code">isEmpty()</span>.  Inside the class, use an <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>
to hold the items on the stack.</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<pre>public class Stack&lt;T&gt; {
   ArrayList&lt;T&gt; stack = new ArrayList&lt;T&gt;();
   public void push( T newItem ) {
      stack.add(newItem);
   }  
   public T pop() {
      int top = stack.size() - 1;  // location of top item
      return stack.remove(top);    // remove and return top item
   }
   public boolean isEmpty() {
      return stack.size() == 0;
   }
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;12:</p>
<p>Write a generic method, using a generic type parameter <span class="code">&lt;T&gt;</span>,
that replaces every occurrence in an <span class="classname">ArrayList&lt;T&gt;</span> of a specified item
with a specified replacement item.  The list and the two items are parameters to the method.
Both items are of type <span class="classname">T</span>.
Take into account the fact that the item that is being replaced might be <span class="code">null</span>.
For a non-null item, use <span class="code">equals()</span> to do the comparison.</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>Since the method operates on <span class="classname">ArrayLists</span>, it can
use indexed access with the <span class="code">get(i)</span> and <span class="code">set(i,item)</span> methods.
These operations are efficient for array lists.  I also give a second version of
the method that uses a list iterator and is efficient for any type of list.</p>

<pre>public static &lt;T&gt; void replaceAll(ArrayList&lt;T&gt; list, T oldItem, T newItem) {
   if (oldItem == null) {
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; list.size(); i++) {
         if ( null == list.get(i) )
            list.set( i, newItem );
      }
   }
   else {
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; list.size(); i++) {
         if ( oldItem.equals(list.get(i)) )
            list.set( i, newItem );
      }
   }
}


public static &lt;T&gt; void replaceAll(List&lt;T&gt; list, T oldItem, T newItem) {
   ListIterator&lt;T&gt; iter = list.listIterator();
   while (iter.hasNext()) {
      T listItem = iter.next();
      if ( oldItem == null ) {
         if ( listItem == null )
            iter.set(newItem);
      }
      else {
         if ( oldItem.equals(listItem) )
            iter.set(newItem);
      }
   }
}</pre>

<p>(Note, by the way, that a <span class="code">replaceAll</span> method is already defined
as a static method in class <span class="classname">Collections</span>.)</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;13:</p>
<p>Suppose that <span class="code">words</span> is an array of <span class="classname">Strings</span>.
Explain what is done by the following code:</p>

<pre>long n = Arrays.stream(words)
               .filter( w -&gt; (w != null) )
               .map( w -&gt; w.toLowerCase() )
               .distinct()
               .count();</pre>

</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>This code counts the number of different strings in the array, ignoring
case.  It starts with a stream containing all the strings from the array.
The <span class="code">filter()</span> operation only lets non-null values through.
This makes sure that there won't be a <span class="code">NullPointerExcetion</span>
in the next step, when <span class="code">w.toLowerCase()</span> is evaluated.
The <span class="code">map()</span> replaces each string in the stream with a lower case
version, so that there will be no difference between upper and lower case
versions of the same string.  The <span class="code">distinct() eliminates duplicates
from the stream.  And <span class="code">count()</span> returns the number of strings
in the resulting. stream, which now contains just one lower-case copy
of every string that occurs in the array.</span>
</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;14:</p>
<p>Use the stream API to print all the even integers from 2 to 20.
Start with <span class="code">IntStream.range</span> and apply a
<span class="code">filter</span> operation.</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>

<pre>IntStream.range(2,20)
         .filter( n -&gt; (n % 2 == 0) )
         .forEach( n -&gt; System.out.println(n) );</pre>
              

<p>(<span class="code">IntStream.range()</span> can be used to create a stream
containing all of the integers 2 to 20.  The predicate
"<span class="code">n&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;(n%2&nbsp;==&nbsp;0)</span>" is true just for
even integers, so the stream that emerges from the <span class="code">filter</span>
operation contains the numbers 2, 4, ... 20.  Finally, we can
apply an operation to each of the numbers of the stream by using
the <span class="code">forEach</span> terminal operator.  The operation
<span class="code">forEachOrdered</span> would also work, but since the stream
is sequential, <span class="code">forEach</span> will print out the numbers in 
order.  If we were using a parallel stream, it is possible that
<span class="code">forEach</span> could print the numbers out of order.)</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;15:</p>
<p>Write a generic method <span class="code">countIf(c,t)</span> with
type parameter <span class="code">&lt;T&gt;</span>, where the first parameter,
<span class="code">c</span>, is of type <span class="atype">Collection&lt;T&gt;</span>,
and the second parameter, <span class="code">p</span>, is of type
<span class="atype">Predicate&lt;T&gt;</span>.  The method should return
the number of items in the collection for which the predicate
is true.  Give two versions, one using a loop and the other
using the stream API.</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>The first version uses a for-each loop, and uses the fact that
a <span class="classname">Predicate</span> contains a <span class="ptype">boolean</span>-valued
function named <span class="code">test()</span> for testing whether the predicate is
true:</p>


<pre>public static &lt;T&gt; int countIf( Collection&lt;T&gt; items, Predicate&lt;T&gt; pred ) ) {
    int count = 0;
    for ( T x : items ) {
        if ( pred.test(x) )
            count++;
    }
    return count;
}</pre>


<p>The second version uses the stream API, with a <span class="code">filter()</span> operation
that lets through only the items for which the predicate is true.  Note that
<span class="code">filter()</span> takes a parameter that is a predicate.  Usually, the
parameter is given by a lambda expression, but in this case, the predicate is
<span class="code">pred</span>, so we need to pass <span class="code">pred</span> as the paramter
to <span class="code">filter()</span>.</p>


<pre>public static &lt;T&gt; int countIf( Collection&lt;T&gt; items, Predicate&lt;T&gt; pred ) {
    long ct = items.parallelStream()
                   .filter(pred)
                   .count();
         // .count() returns a long, but I want countIf to return an int
    return (int)ct;
