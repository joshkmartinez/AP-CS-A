<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 10.3</h2>
<hr class="break">
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 10.3:</h3>
<p>The fact that Java has a
<span class="classname">HashMap</span> class means that no Java programmer has to write an
implementation of hash tables from scratch&mdash;unless, of course, that programmer is a
computer science student.</p>

<p>For this exercise, you should write a hash table in which both the keys and the values are of
type <span class="classname">String</span>.  (This is not an exercise in generic programming;
do not try to write a generic class.)
Write an implementation of hash tables from scratch. Define the following
methods: <span class="code">get(key)</span>, <span class="code">put(key,value)</span>, <span class="code">remove(key)</span>,
<span class="code">containsKey(key)</span>, and <span class="code">size()</span>. 
Remember that every object, <span class="code">obj</span>, has a method <span class="code">obj.hashCode()</span>
that can be used for computing a hash code for the object,
so at least you don't have to define your own hash function. 
Do not use <b>any</b> of Java's built-in generic types; create your own linked
lists using nodes as covered in <a href="../c9/s2.html#recursion.2.2">Subsection&nbsp;9.2.2</a>.  However,
you are <b>not</b> required to increase the size of the table when
it becomes too full.</p>

<p>You should also write a short program to test your solution.</p>

<p>Hash tables are discussed in <a href="../c10/s3.html#generics.3.3">Subsection&nbsp;10.3.3</a>.
A hash table is just an array of linked lists. Each linked list holds all
the items in the table that share the same hash code. Initially, all the lists
are empty (represented as <span class="code">null</span> in the array). We need to be able to
add and delete items in the list. Methods for inserting and deleting
items can be found in <a href="../c9/s2.html#recursion.2.2">Subsection&nbsp;9.2.2</a>.
In a hash table, the order of items in a particular
list doesn't matter, so I simply insert each new item at the beginning of the
list. This makes the insert operation fairly simple. Deletion, however, is more
complicated, since we need to be able to delete an item no matter where it
occurs in a list.</p>


<p>A hash table really contains pairs of items, where each pair consists of a
key and an associated value.  To implement this, I use linked lists in which
each node contains both a key 
and a value, as well as the pointer to the next node in the list. The
end of a list is marked, as usual, by a <span class="code">null</span> pointer. The nodes are
defined by a static nested class:</p>


<pre>private static class ListNode {
   String key;
   String value;
   ListNode next;
}</pre>


<p>The array of linked lists that stores all the data is of type
<span class="atype">ListNode[]</span>. Each item in the array is either <span class="code">null</span> to indicate
an empty list, or it is a pointer to the first node in a linked list.</p>


<p>Given any key, we can find the linked list that should contain that key by
looking at the hash code of the key. The code computed by calling
<span class="code">key.hashCode()</span>, which returns a value of type <span class="ptype">int</span>. We need a value that is in the
range of legal indices for the array. As noted in <a href="../c10/s3.html#generics.3.3">Subsection&nbsp;10.3.3</a>,
the value can be computed as <span class="code">Math.abs(key.hashCode())&nbsp;%&nbsp;table.length</span>, 
where <span class="code">table</span> is the array.</p>


<p>The hash code is used in all the methods that deal with keys, to decide which
linked list to look at. Once a list has been selected, the operations on the
list are pretty straightforward (given all the information and code in <a href="../c9/s2.html#recursion.2.2">Subsection&nbsp;9.2.2</a>), 
so I will not discuss them further here. You can look at the solution, below.</p>


<p>Although it is not required by the exercise, I defined a <span class="code">resize()</span>
method that is used to increase the size of the table when the table becomes
too full. I call this method in the <span class="code">put()</span> method when the table
becomes more than 3/4 full.  The hash table class has an instance variable, <span class="code">count</span>, that
is equal to the number of items in the array, so it only necessary to check the value of
<span class="code">count</span> when deciding to increase the array size.  Having <span class="code">count</span>
is also important for implementing the <span class="code">size()</span> method efficiently, since
<span class="code">size()</span> can simply return <span class="code">count</span> as its return value.</p>


<p>(By the way, the statement that "<span class="code">count</span> is equal to the number of items
in the array"" is a class invariant for the <span class="classname">HashTable</span> class.
(See <a href="../c8/s2.html#robustness.2.3">Subsection&nbsp;8.2.3</a>.)
It is important that all of the methods in the class maintain the truth of this
class invariant.")</p>


<p>A major part of developing a class for general use is testing. It's
important to design a testing procedure that will test all aspects of the
class. For this problem, I wrote a testing program that would allow me to test
each of the methods in the class. I also added a method <span class="code">dump()</span> to the
class; this method displays the entire hash table. This method does not really belong
in the class, since users of a hash table shouldn't care how the data is
stored. But I needed it to make sure that my <span class="code">resize()</span> method is
working properly and that I could delete items correctly from all positions in
the lists (beginning, middle, and end).</p>
   

<p>By the way, you might be tempted to try to write a generic version of
<span class="classname">HashTable</span> in which the types of the keys and values are
given as type parameters in the definition of the class.  Unfortunately, you
would run into problems as soon as you tried to use an array in your class.
Generic classes don't work well with arrays, because arrays of generic type
can't be created at run time, as noted in <a href="../c10/s1.html#generics.1.3">Subsection&nbsp;10.1.3</a>.</p>
