<p>
<span class="start"><big>A</big>n array of N elements</span> can be thought of as a way
of associating some item with each of the integers <span class="code">0</span>, <span class="code">1</span>,
...,&nbsp;<span class="code">N-1</span>. If <span class="code">i</span> is one of these integers, it's possible
to <span class="newword">get</span> the item associated with <span class="code">i</span>, and
it's possible to <span class="newword">put</span> a new item in the <span class="code">i</span>-th
position. These "get" and "put" operations define what it means to be an
array.</p>


<p>A <span class="newword">map</span> is a kind of generalized array. Like an
array, a map is defined by "get" and "put" operations. But in a map, these
operations are defined not for integers <span class="code">0</span>, <span class="code">1</span>,
...,&nbsp;<span class="code">N-1</span>, but for arbitrary objects of some specified
type <span class="classname">T</span>.  Associated to these objects of type <span class="classname">T</span>
are objects of some possibly different type&nbsp;<span class="classname">S</span>.</p>
   

<p>In fact, some
programming languages use the term <span class="newword">associative array</span> 
instead of "map" and use the same notation for associative arrays
as for regular arrays. In those languages, for example, you might see the
notation <span class="code">A["fred"]</span> used to indicate the item associated to the string
"fred" in an associative array&nbsp;<span class="code">A</span>. Java does not use array notation for maps,
unfortunately, but the idea is the same: A map is like an array, but the indices for a map
are objects, not integers. In a map, an object that serves as an
"index" is called a <span class="newword">key</span>. The object that is
associated with a key is called a <span class="newword">value</span>. Note that
a key can have at most one associated value, but the same value can be
associated to several different keys.  A map can be considered to be
a set of "associations," where each association is a key/value pair.</p>

<a name="generics.3.1">10.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;The Map Interface</a>
</h3>


<p>In Java, maps are defined by the interface <span class="code">java.util.Map</span>, which
includes <span class="code">put</span> and <span class="code">get</span> methods as well as other general methods
for working with maps.  The map interface, <span class="classname">Map&lt;K,V&gt;</span>, is
parameterized by <b>two</b> types.  The first type parameter, <span class="classname">K</span>,
specifies the type of objects that are possible keys in the map; the second type parameter,
<span class="classname">V</span>, specifies the type of objects that are possible values in the
map.  For example, a map of type <span class="classname">Map&lt;Date,Button&gt;</span>
would associate values of type <span class="classname">Button</span> to keys of
type <span class="classname">Date</span>.  For a map of type
<span class="classname">Map&lt;String,String&gt;</span>, both the keys and the values
are of type <span class="classname">String</span>.</p>


<p>Suppose that <span class="code">map</span> is a variable of type <span class="classname">Map&lt;K,V&gt;</span>
for some specific types <span class="classname">K</span> and <span class="classname">V</span>. Then
the following are some of the methods that are defined for <span class="code">map</span>:</p>


<ul>

<li>
<span class="codedef">map.get(key)</span> &mdash; returns the
object of type <span class="classname">V</span> that is associated by the map to the
<span class="code">key</span>.
If the map does not associate any value with <span class="code">key</span>, then
the return value is <span class="code">null</span>. Note that it's also possible for the return
value to be <span class="code">null</span> when the map explicitly associates the value
<span class="code">null</span> with the key. Referring to "<span class="code">map.get(key)</span>" is similar to
referring to "<span class="code">A[key]</span>" for an array&nbsp;<span class="code">A</span>. (But note that
there is nothing like an <span class="classname">IndexOutOfBoundsException</span> for maps.)</li>


<li>
<span class="codedef">map.put(key,value)</span> &mdash; Associates the
specified <span class="code">value</span> with the specified <span class="code">key</span>, where <span class="code">key</span>
must be of type <span class="classname">K</span> and <span class="code">value</span> must be of
type <span class="classname">V</span>. If the map already associated some other
value with the key, then the new value replaces the old one. This is similar to
the command "<span class="code">A[key]&nbsp;=&nbsp;value</span>" for an array.</li>


<li>
<span class="codedef">map.putAll(map2)</span> &mdash; if <span class="code">map2</span>
is another map of type <span class="classname">Map&lt;K,V&gt;</span>, 
this copies all the associations from <span class="code">map2</span> into map.
</li>


<li>
<span class="codedef">map.remove(key)</span> &mdash; if <span class="code">map</span>
associates a value to the specified <span class="code">key</span>, that association is removed
from the map.</li>


<li>
<span class="codedef">map.containsKey(key)</span> &mdash; returns a
boolean value that is <span class="code">true</span> if the map associates some value to the
specified <span class="code">key</span>.</li>


<li>
<span class="codedef">map.containsValue(value)</span> &mdash; returns a
boolean value that is <span class="code">true</span> if the map associates the specified
<span class="code">value</span> to some key.</li>


<li>
<span class="codedef">map.size()</span> &mdash; returns an <span class="ptype">int</span>
that gives the number of key/value associations in the map.</li>


<li>
<span class="codedef">map.isEmpty()</span> &mdash; returns a boolean
value that is <span class="code">true</span> if the map is empty, that is if it contains no
associations.</li>


<li>
<span class="codedef">map.clear()</span> &mdash; removes all
associations from the map, leaving it empty.</li>

</ul>


<p>The <span class="code">put</span> and <span class="code">get</span> methods are certainly the most commonly
used of the methods in the <span class="classname">Map</span> interface. In many applications, these
are the only methods that are needed, and in such cases a map is really no more
difficult to use than a standard array.</p>


<p>Java includes two classes that implement the interface <span class="classname">Map&lt;K,V&gt;</span>:
<span class="classname">TreeMap&lt;K,V&gt;</span> and <span class="classname">HashMap&lt;K,V&gt;</span>. 
In a <span class="classname">TreeMap</span>, the key/value
associations are stored in a sorted tree, in which they are sorted according to
their <span class="code">keys</span>. For this to work, it must be possible to compare the keys
to one another. This means either that the keys must implement the interface
<span class="classname">Comparable&lt;K&gt;</span>, or that a <span class="classname">Comparator</span> must be provided
for comparing keys. (The <span class="classname">Comparator</span> can be provided as a parameter to
the <span class="classname">TreeMap</span> constructor.)  Note that in a <span class="classname">TreeMap</span>,
as in a <span class="classname">TreeSet</span>, the <span class="code">compareTo()</span> (or <span class="code">compare()</span>) method is used
to decide whether two keys are to be considered the same.  This can have undesirable
consequences if the <span class="code">compareTo()</span> method does not agree with the usual
notion of equality, and you should keep this in mind when using <span class="classname">TreeMaps</span>.</p>


<p>A <span class="classname">HashMap</span> does not store associations in any particular order, so
the keys that can be used in a <span class="classname">HashMap</span> do not have to be comparable.
However, the key class should have reasonable definitions for the <span class="code">equals()</span> method
and for a <span class="code">hashCode()</span> method that is discussed later in this section; most of Java's
standard classes define these methods correctly.
Most operations are a little faster on <span class="classname">HashMaps</span> than they are on
<span class="classname">TreeMaps</span>. In general, you should use a <span class="classname">HashMap</span> unless you
have some particular need for the ordering property of a <span class="classname">TreeMap</span>. In
particular, if you are only using the <span class="code">put</span> and <span class="code">get</span> operations,
you can safely use a <span class="classname">HashMap</span>.</p>


<p>Let's consider an example where maps would be useful. In <a href="../c7/s4.html#arrays.4.2">Subsection&nbsp;7.4.2</a>, I
presented a simple <span class="classname">PhoneDirectory</span> class that associated phone numbers
with names. That class defined operations <span class="code">addEntry(name,number)</span> and
<span class="code">getNumber(name)</span>, where both <span class="code">name</span> and <span class="code">number</span> are
given as <span class="classname">Strings</span>. In fact, the phone directory is acting just like a
map, with the <span class="code">addEntry</span> method playing the role of the <span class="code">put</span>
operation and <span class="code">getNumber</span> playing the role of <span class="code">get</span>. In a real
programming application, there would be no need to define a new class; we could
simply use a map of type <span class="classname">Map&lt;String,String&gt;</span>. A directory
could be defined as</p>
   

<pre>Map&lt;String,String&gt; directory = new TreeMap&lt;&gt;();</pre>
   

<p>(using <span class="classname">TreeMap</span> so that the entries are kept in sorted order by name).
Then <span class="code">directory.put(name,number)</span> would record a phone number
in the directory and <span class="code">directory.get(name)</span> would retrieve the phone number
associated with a given name.</p>

<a name="generics.3.2">10.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Views, SubSets, and SubMaps</a>
</h3>


<p>A <span class="classname">Map</span> is not a <span class="classname">Collection</span>, and maps do not implement all
the operations defined on collections. In particular, there are no iterators
for maps. Sometimes, though, it's useful to be able to iterate through all the
associations in a map. Java makes this possible in a roundabout but clever
way. If <span class="code">map</span> is a variable of type <span class="classname">Map&lt;K,V&gt;</span>, then the method</p>


<pre>map.keySet()</pre>


<p>returns the set of all objects that occur as keys for associations in the
map. The value returned by this method is an object that implements the interface 
<span class="classname">Set&lt;K&gt;</span>. The elements of this set are the map's keys. The obvious way to
implement the <span class="code">keySet()</span> method would be to create a new set object, add
all the keys from the map, and return that set. But that's not how it's done.
The value returned by <span class="code">map.keySet()</span> is not an independent object. It is
what is called a <span class="newword">view</span> of the actual objects that are stored
in the map. This "view" of the map implements the <span class="classname">Set&lt;K&gt;</span> interface, but
it does it in such a way that the methods defined in the interface refer
directly to keys in the map. For example, if you remove a key from the view,
that key&mdash;along with its associated value&mdash;is actually removed from the
map. It's not legal to add an object to the view, since it doesn't make sense
to add a key to a map without specifying the value that should be associated to
the key. Since <span class="code">map.keySet()</span> does not create a new set, it's very
efficient, even for very large maps.</p>


<p>One of the things that you can do with a <span class="classname">Set</span> is get an
<span class="classname">Iterator</span> for it and use the iterator to visit each of the elements of
the set in turn. We can use an iterator for the key set of a map to traverse
the map. For example, if <span class="code">map</span> is of type <span class="classname">Map&lt;String,Double&gt;</span>,
we could write:</p>


<pre>Set&lt;String&gt; keys = map.keySet();     // The set of keys in the map.
Iterator&lt;String&gt; keyIter = keys.iterator();
System.out.println("The map contains the following associations:");
while (keyIter.hasNext()) {
   String key = keyIter.next();  // Get the next key.
   Double value = map.get(key);  // Get the value for that key.
   System.out.println( "   (" + key + "," + value + ")" );
}</pre>
   

<p>Or we could do the same thing more easily, avoiding the explicit use of an iterator,
with a for-each loop:</p>


<pre>System.out.println("The map contains the following associations:");
for ( String key : map.keySet() ) {  // "for each key in the map's key set"
    Double value = map.get(key);
    System.out.println( "   (" + key + "," + value + ")" );
}</pre>
   
   

<p>If the map is a <span class="classname">TreeMap</span>, then the key set of the map is a sorted
set, and the iterator will visit the keys in ascending order.  For a <span class="classname">HashMap</span>,
the keys are visited in an arbitrary, unpredictable order.</p>


<p>The <span class="classname">Map</span> interface defines two other views. If <span class="code">map</span> is a
variable of type <span class="classname">Map&lt;K,V&gt;</span>, then the method:</p>


<pre>map.values()</pre>


<p>returns an object of type <span class="classname">Collection&lt;V&gt;</span>
that contains all the values from the
associations that are stored in the map. The return value is a
<span class="classname">Collection</span> rather than a <span class="classname">Set</span> because it can contain duplicate
elements (since a map can associate the same value to any number of keys). The
method:</p>


<pre>map.entrySet()</pre>


<p>returns a set that contains all the associations from the map.  The
elements in the set are objects of type <span class="classname">Map.Entry&lt;K,V&gt;</span>.
<span class="classname">Map.Entry&lt;K,V&gt;</span> is defined as a static nested interface
inside the interface <span class="classname">Map&lt;K,V&gt;</span>, so
its full name contains a period. However, the name can be used in the same way as
any other type name.  (The return type
of the method <span class="code">map.entrySet()</span> is written as
<span class="classname">Set&lt;Map.Entry&lt;K,V&gt;&gt;</span>.  The type parameter
in this case is itself a parameterized type.  Although this might look
confusing, it's just Java's way of saying that the elements of the
set are of type <span class="classname">Map.Entry&lt;K,V&gt;</span>.)
The information in the set returned by <span class="code">map.entrySet()</span>
is actually no different from the information in the
map itself, but the set provides a different view of this information, with
different operations. Each <span class="code">Map.Entry</span>
object contains one key/value pair, and defines methods <span class="code">getKey()</span> and
<span class="code">getValue()</span> for retrieving the key and the value. There is also a
method, <span class="code">setValue(value)</span>, for setting the value; calling this
method for a <span class="code">Map.Entry</span> object will modify the map itself,
just as if the map's <span class="code">put</span> method were called.
As an example, we can use the entry
set of a map to print all the key/value pairs in the map. This is more efficient than
using the key set to print the same information, as I did in the above example,
since we don't have to use the <span class="code">get()</span> method to look up the value associated with each key.
Suppose again that <span class="code">map</span> is of type <span class="classname">Map&lt;String,Double&gt;</span>.
Then we can write:</p>


<pre>Set&lt;Map.Entry&lt;String,Double&gt;&gt; entries = map.entrySet();
Iterator&lt;Map.Entry&lt;String,Double&gt;&gt; entryIter = entries.iterator();
System.out.println("The map contains the following associations:");
while (entryIter.hasNext()) {
   Map.Entry&lt;String,Double&gt; entry = entryIter.next();
   String key = entry.getKey();  // Get the key from the entry.
   Double value = entry.getValue();  // Get the value.
   System.out.println( "   (" + key + "," + value + ")" );
}</pre>
   

<p>or, using a for-each loop to avoid some of the ugly type names:</p>


<pre>System.out.println("The map contains the following associations:");
for ( Map.Entry&lt;String,Double&gt; entry : map.entrySet() ) {
   System.out.println( "   (" + entry.getKey() + "," + entry.getValue() + ")" );
}</pre>
   

<hr class="break">
   

<p>Maps are not the only place in Java's generic programming framework where
views are used. For example, the interface <span class="classname">List&lt;T&gt;</span> defines a 
<span class="newword">sublist</span> as a view of a part of a list. If <span class="code">list</span>
implements the interface <span class="classname">List&lt;T&gt;</span>, then
the method</p>


<pre>list.subList( fromIndex, toIndex )</pre>


<p>where <span class="code">fromIndex</span> and <span class="code">toIndex</span> are integers,
returns a view of the part of the list consisting of the list elements in
positions between <span class="code">fromIndex</span> and <span class="code">toIndex</span> (including
<span class="code">fromIndex</span> but excluding <span class="code">toIndex</span>). This view lets you operate
on the sublist using any of the operations defined for lists, but the sublist
is not an independent list. Changes made to the sublist are actually  made
to the original list.</p>


<p>Similarly, it is possible to obtain views that represent certain subsets of
a sorted set. If <span class="code">set</span> is of type <span class="classname">TreeSet&lt;T&gt;</span>, then
<span class="code">set.subSet(fromElement,toElement)</span> returns a <span class="classname">Set&lt;T&gt;</span> that contains
all the elements of <span class="code">set</span> that are between <span class="code">fromElement</span> and
<span class="code">toElement</span> (including <span class="code">fromElement</span> and excluding
<span class="code">toElement</span>).  The parameters <span class="code">fromElement</span> and <span class="code">toElement</span>
must be objects of type&nbsp;<span class="classname">T</span>.
For example, if <span class="code">words</span> is a set of type <span class="classname">TreeSet&lt;String&gt;</span> in
which all the elements are strings of lower case letters, then
<span class="code">words.subSet("m","n")</span> contains all the elements of <span class="code">words</span> that
begin with the letter&nbsp;'m'. This subset is a view of part of the original set.
That is, creating the subset does not involve copying elements. And changes
made to the subset, such as adding or removing elements, are actually made to
the original set. The view <span class="code">set.headSet(toElement)</span> consists of all
elements from the set which are strictly less than <span class="code">toElement</span>, and
<span class="code">set.tailSet(fromElement)</span> is a view that contains all elements from the
set that are greater than or equal to <span class="code">fromElement</span>.</p>


<p>The class <span class="classname">TreeMap&lt;K,V&gt;</span> defines three submap views. A submap is similar
to a subset. A submap is a <span class="classname">Map</span> that contains a subset of the keys from
the original <span class="classname">Map</span>, along with their associated values. If <span class="code">map</span>
is a variable of type <span class="classname">TreeMap&lt;K,V&gt;</span>, and if <span class="code">fromKey</span>
and <span class="code">toKey</span> are of type&nbsp;<span class="classname">K</span>,
then <span class="code">map.subMap(fromKey,toKey)</span>
returns a view that contains all key/value pairs from <span class="code">map</span> whose keys
are between <span class="code">fromKey</span> and <span class="code">toKey</span> (including <span class="code">fromKey</span> and
excluding <span class="code">toKey</span>). There are also views <span class="code">map.headMap(toKey)</span> and
<span class="code">map.tailMap(fromKey)</span> which are defined analogously to <span class="code">headSet</span>
and <span class="code">tailSet</span>. Suppose,
for example, that <span class="code">phoneBook</span> is a map of type
<span class="classname">TreeMap&lt;String,String&gt;</span> in which the keys
are names and the values are phone numbers. We can print out all the entries
from <span class="code">phoneBook</span> where the name begins with "M" as follows:</p>


<pre>Map&lt;String,String&gt; ems = phoneBook.subMap("M","N");
     // This submap contains entries for which the key is greater
     // than or equal to "M" and strictly less than "N".
     
if (ems.isEmpty()) {
   System.out.println("No entries beginning with M.");
}
else {
   System.out.println("Entries beginning with M:");
   for ( Map.Entry&lt;String,String&gt; entry : ems.entrySet() )
      System.out.println( "   " + entry.getKey() + ": " + entry.getValue() );
}</pre>


<p>Subsets and submaps are probably best thought of as generalized search
operations that make it possible to find all the items in a range of values,
rather than just to find a single value. For example, suppose that a database
of scheduled events is stored in a map of type <span class="classname">TreeMap&lt;Date,Event&gt;</span> 
in which the keys are the
times of the events, and suppose you want a listing of all events that are
scheduled for some time on July 4, 2018. Just make a submap containing all keys
in the range from 12:00 AM, July 4, 2018 to 12:00 AM, July 5, 2018, and output
all the entries from that submap. This type of search, which is known as a
<span class="newword">subrange query</span>, is quite common.</p>

<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="generics.3.3">10.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Hash Tables and Hash Codes</a>
</h3>


<p>
<span class="classname">HashSets</span> and <span class="classname">HashMaps</span> are implemented using a data
structure known as a <span class="newword">hash table</span>. You don't need to
understand hash tables to use <span class="classname">HashSets</span> or <span class="classname">HashMaps</span>, but any
computer programmer should be familiar with hash tables and how they work.</p>


<p>Hash tables are an elegant solution to the search problem. A hash table,
like a <span class="classname">HashMap</span>, stores key/value pairs. Given a key, you have to
search the table for the corresponding key/value pair. When a hash table is
used to implement a set, there are no values, and the only question is
whether or not the key occurs in the set. You still have to search for the key
to check whether it is there or not.</p>


<p>In most search algorithms, in order to find the item you are interested in,
you have to look through a bunch of other items that don't interest you. To
find something in an unsorted list, you have to go through the items one-by-one
until you come to the one you are looking for. In a binary sort tree, you have
to start at the root and move down the tree until you find the item you want.
When you search for a key/value pair in a hash table, you can go directly to
the location that contains the item you want. You don't have to look through
any other items. (This is not quite true, but if the hash table is working properly,
it's close.) The location of the
key/value pair is computed from the key: You just look at the key, and then you
go directly to the location where it is stored.</p>


<p>How can this work? If the keys were integers in the range 0 to 99, we could
store the key/value pairs in an array, <span class="code">A</span>, of 100 elements. The
key/value pair with key <span class="code">K</span> would be stored in <span class="code">A[K]</span>. The key
takes us directly to the location of the key/value pair. The problem is that
there are usually far too many different possible keys for us to be able to use
an array with one location for each possible key. For example, if the key can
be any value of type <span class="ptype">int</span>, then we would need an array with over four
billion locations&mdash;quite a waste of space if we are only going to store, say,
a few thousand items! If the key can be a string of any length, then the number
of possible keys is infinite, and using an array with one location for each
possible key is simply impossible.</p>


<p>Nevertheless, hash tables store their data in an array, and the array index
where a key is stored is based on the key. The index is not equal to the key,
but it is computed from the key. The array index for a key is called the
<span class="newword">hash code</span> for that key. A function that computes a
hash code, given a key, is called a <span class="newword">hash function</span>.
To find a key in a hash table, you just have to compute the hash code of the
key and go directly to the array location given by that hash code. If the hash
code is 17, look in array location number 17.</p>


<p>Now, since there are fewer array locations than there are possible keys,
it's possible that we might try to store two or more keys in the same array
location. This is called a <span class="newword">collision</span>. A collision
is not an error. We can't reject a key just because another key happened to
have the same hash code. A hash table must be able to handle collisions in some
reasonable way. In the type of hash table that is used in Java, each array
location actually holds a linked list of key/value pairs (possibly an empty
list). When two items have the same hash code, they are in the same linked
list. The structure of the hash table looks something like this:</p>


<p align="center">

<p>In this diagram, there are two items with hash code 0, no items with hash code
1, one item with hash code 2, and so on. In a properly designed hash table,
most of the linked lists are of length zero or one, and the average length of
the lists is less than one. Although the hash code of a key doesn't necessarily
take you directly to that key, there are probably no more than one or two other
items that you have to look through before finding the key you want. For this
to work properly, the number of items in the hash table should be somewhat less
than the number of locations in the array. In Java's implementation, whenever
the number of items exceeds 75% of the array size, the array is replaced by a
larger one and all the items in the old array are inserted into the new
one. (This is why adding one new item will sometimes cause the ordering of all
the items in the hash table to change completely.)</p>


<p>There is still the question of where hash codes come from.  Every object in
Java has a hash code.
The <span class="classname">Object</span> class defines the method <span class="code">hashCode()</span>, which
returns a value of type <span class="ptype">int</span>.  When an object, <span class="code">obj</span>, is stored
in a hash table that has <span class="code">N</span> locations, a hash code in the range
<span class="code">0</span> to <span class="code">N-1</span> is needed. This hash code is computed as
<span class="code">Math.abs(obj.hashCode())&nbsp;%&nbsp;N</span>, the remainder when the absolute value of
<span class="code">obj.hashCode()</span> is divided by <span class="code">N</span>. (The <span class="code">Math.abs</span> is
necessary because <span class="code">obj.hashCode()</span> can be a negative integer, and we
need a non-negative number to use as an array index.)</p>


<p>For hashing to work properly, two objects that are equal according to the
<span class="code">equals()</span> method must have the same hash code. In the <span class="classname">Object</span>
class, this condition is satisfied because
both <span class="code">equals()</span> and <span class="code">hashCode()</span> are based on the address
of the memory location where the object is stored. 
However, as noted in
<a href="../c10/s1.html#generics.1.6">Subsection&nbsp;10.1.6</a>, many classes redefine the <span class="code">equals()</span>
method. If a class redefines the <span class="code">equals()</span> method, and if objects of
that class will be used as keys in hash tables, then the class must also
redefine the <span class="code">hashCode()</span> method. For example, in the <span class="classname">String</span>
class, the <span class="code">equals()</span> method is redefined so that two objects of type
<span class="classname">String</span> are considered to be equal if they contain the same sequence of
characters. The <span class="code">hashCode()</span> method is also redefined in the
<span class="classname">String</span> class, so that the hash code of a string is computed from the
characters in that string rather than from its location in memory. For Java's
standard classes, you can expect <span class="code">equals()</span> and <span class="code">hashCode()</span> to
be correctly defined. However, you might need to define these methods in
classes that you write yourself.</p>
   

<p>Writing a good hash function is something of an art.  In order to work well, the hash
function must spread the possible keys fairly evenly over the hash table.  Otherwise,
the items in a table can be concentrated in a subset of the available locations, and the
linked lists at those locations can grow to a large size; that would destroy the efficiency
that is the major reason for hash tables to exist in the first place.  However, I won't
cover techniques for creating good hash functions in this book.</p>
