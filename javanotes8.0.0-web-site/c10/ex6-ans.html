<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 10.6</h2>
<hr class="break">
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 10.6:</h3>
<p>An example in
<a href="../c10/s4.html#generics.4.2">Subsection&nbsp;10.4.2</a> concerns the problem of making an index for
a book. A related problem is making a <span class="newword">concordance</span>
for a document. A concordance lists every word that occurs in the document, and
for each word it gives the line number of every line in the document where the
word occurs. All the subroutines for creating an index that were presented in
<a href="../c10/s4.html#generics.4.2">Subsection&nbsp;10.4.2</a> can also be used to create a concordance. The only real
difference is that the integers in a concordance are line numbers rather than
page numbers.</p>


<p>Write a program that can create a concordance. The document should be read
from an input file, and the concordance data should be written to an output
file. You can use the indexing
subroutines from <a href="../c10/s4.html#generics.4.2">Subsection&nbsp;10.4.2</a>, modified to write the data to <span class="code">TextIO</span>
instead of to <span class="code">System.out</span>. (You will need to make these subroutines
<span class="code">static</span>.) The input and output files should be selected by the user when
the program is run.  The sample program <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter10/WordCount.java">WordCount.java</a></span>,
from <a href="../c10/s4.html#generics.4.4">Subsection&nbsp;10.4.4</a>, can be used as a model of how to use files.
That program also has a useful subroutine that reads one word from input.</p>


<p>As you read the file, you want to take each word that you encounter and add
it to the concordance along with the current line number.  Keeping track of
the line numbers is one of the trickiest parts of the problem. In an input file,
the end of each line in the file is
marked by the newline character,&nbsp;'\n'. Every time you encounter this
character, you have to add one to the line number.  WordCount.java
ignores ends of lines.  Because you need to
find and count the end-of-line characters, your program cannot
process the input file in exactly the same way as does WordCount.java.
Also, you will need to detect the end of the file.  The function
<span class="code">TextIO.peek()</span>, which is used to look ahead at the next character
in the input, returns the value <span class="code">TextIO.EOF</span> at end-of-file,
after all the characters in the file have been read.</p>


<p>Because it is so common, don't include the word "the" in your concordance.
Also, do not include words that have length less than&nbsp;3.</p>

<big><b>Discussion</b></big>

<hr>
<p>Solving this exercise, for the most part, means collecting subroutines that
were presented in <a href="../c10/s4.html#generics.4.2">Subsection&nbsp;10.4.2</a> into a complete program. 
I copied the method <span class="code">addReference()</span> directly, just making it <span class="code">static</span>
and changing the names of the parameters to names that are more appropriate for
a concordance. I copied <span class="code">printIntegers()</span>, changed its name
to <span class="code">printConcordance</span>, made it static, and changed
"System.out.print" to "TextIO.put" so that it would send its output to the file
selected by the user.</p>
   

<p>In <a href="../c10/s4.html#generics.4.3">Subsection&nbsp;10.4.3</a>, I discussed the problem that arises when
comparing strings that differ only in their use of upper and lower case.  In that
subsection, I used a <span class="classname">Comparator</span> to solve the problem.
In my solution to this exercise, however, I used the simpler solution of
converting all words to lower case immediately after reading them from the
file.  For lower case words, the default ordering is alphabetical order,
so I don't need a <span class="classname">Comparator</span>.</p>


<p>It remains to write the <span class="code">main()</span> routine, which is similar in outline
to the <span class="code">main()</span> routine in <span class="code">WordCount.java</span>. One difference is
that we have to keep track of line numbers. We can do this by looking for
new-line characters as we skip over the characters between words. 
While we do this, we have to be on the alert for the special character
<span class="code">TextIO.EOF</span> that is returned by <span class="code">TextIO.peek()</span>
when the end of the file is reached.  A pseudocode algorithm can be given as:</p>


<pre>Open the input files.

Let lineNum = 1.

Repeat:
   
      // Skip over any non-letters in the input, stopping when a
      // letter (marking the beginning of a word) or EOF is found.
      
      while the next character is not end-of-file or a letter:
         Read the next character.
         If it is a new line character:
            Count the line by adding 1 to lineNum
      
      // After the while loop, we are looking at either the end of file
      //    or at a letter that is the beginning of the next word.
      
      If at end-of-file:
         Exit from the loop.
      
      Get the next word from the input file.
      Convert the word to lower case.
      if the word is not "the" and has length &gt; 2:
         Add the word and lineNum to the concordance.

Open the output file.

Print the concordance.</pre>



<p>This can be translated directly (using some code from <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter10/WordCount.java">WordCount.java</a></span>)
to give the <span class="code">main()</span> routine.   For reading individual words from
input, the method <span class="code">readNextWord()</span> can be copied directly from
WordCount.java.  (In my program, I used a slightly simpler method named
<span class="code">readWord()</span> which uses the fact that when <span class="code">readWord()</span>
is called by the <span class="code">main()</span> routine, the next character in input
is already known to be a letter.)</p>
