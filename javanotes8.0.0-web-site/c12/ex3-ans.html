<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 12.3</h2>
<hr class="break">
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 12.3:</h3>
<p>In the <a href="../c12/ex2-ans.html">previous exercise</a>,
you divided up a large task into a small number of large pieces and created a thread to 
execute each task.  Because of the nature of the problem, this meant that some threads
had much more work to do than others&mdash;it is much easier to find the number of 
divisors of a small number than it is of a big number.  As discussed in <a href="../c12/s3.html#threads.3.1">Subsection&nbsp;12.3.1</a>,
a better approach is to break up the problem into a fairly large number of smaller
problems.  <a href="../c12/s3.html#threads.3.2">Subsection&nbsp;12.3.2</a> shows how to use a thread pool to execute the
tasks: Each thread in the pool runs in a loop in which it repeatedly takes a task
from a queue and carries out that task.  Implement a thread pool strategy for
solving the same maximum-number-of-divisors problem as in the previous exercise.</p>

<p>To make things even more interesting, you should try a new technique for combining
the results from all the tasks:  Use two queues in your program.  Use a queue of tasks,
as usual, to hold the tasks that will be executed by the thread pool (<a href="../c12/s3.html#threads.3.2">Subsection&nbsp;12.3.2</a>).  But also use a queue
of results produced by the threads.  When a task completes, the result from that task
should be placed into the result queue.  The main program can read results from the
second queue as they become available, and combine all the results to get the final
answer.   The result queue will have to be a blocking queue (<a href="../c12/s3.html#threads.3.3">Subsection&nbsp;12.3.3</a>), since
the main program will have to wait for results to become available.  Note that the
main program knows the exact number of results that it expects to read from the
queue, so it can do so in a <span class="code">for</span> loop; when the <span class="code">for</span> loop
completes, the main program knows that all the tasks have been executed.</p>

<p>I ran the solution to <a href="../c12/ex2-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;12.2</a> on an old computer with
four processors, using four threads.  The four threads took widely varying amounts
of time to complete:  2.6 seconds, 6.4 seconds, 12.9 seconds, and
20.4 seconds.  The program ran for just over 20.4 seconds. For a lot
of that time, there were only one or two threads running, leaving several
processors idle.  By using a thread pool as required by the current
exercise,  I was able to bring the total time for solving the problem down to 
10.9 seconds.  With the thread pool, the job was divided more evenly among
the processors, and none of the processors were idle for very long.
</p>

<p>In my solution, I decided to use a <span class="classname">ConcurrentLinkedQueue</span>
for the task queue and a <span class="classname">LinkedBlockingQueue</span> for the
result queue.  Both of these classes are discussed in <a href="../c12/s3.html">Section&nbsp;12.3</a>,
and a <span class="classname">ConcurrentLinkedQueue</span> is used for the task queue
in the sample program <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter12/MultiprocessingDemo2.java">MultiprocessingDemo2.java</a></span> from that section.
(I could have used a blocking queue for the task queue too, as I'll discuss below.)</p>


<pre>private static ConcurrentLinkedQueue&lt;Task&gt; taskQueue;
private static LinkedBlockingQueue&lt;Result&gt; resultQueue;</pre>


<p>We need objects to put in the queues, to represent the tasks and the results.
I decided to write a nested class to represent tasks and another nested class
to represent results.  A task is assigned a range of integers and has to find
the largest number of divisors for any integer in that range.  We also need to
know which integer gave that maximum number.  When the task is completed, the
results from the task have to be added to the result queue.  Here are the
<span class="classname">Task</span> and <span class="classname">Result</span> classes:</p>


<pre>private static class Task {
    int min, max; // Start and end of the range of integers for this task.
    Task(int min, int max) {
        this.min = min;
        this.max = max;
    }
    public void compute() {
        int maxDivisors = 0;
        int whichInt = 0;
        for (int i = min; i &lt; max; i++) {
            int divisors = countDivisors(i);
            if (divisors &gt; maxDivisors) {
                maxDivisors = divisors;
                whichInt = i;
            }
        }
        resultQueue.add( new Result(maxDivisors, whichInt) );
    }
}

private static class Result {
    int maxDivisorFromTask;  // Maximum number of divisors found.
    int intWithMaxFromTask;  // Which integer gave that maximum number.
    Result(int maxDivisors, int whichInt) {
        maxDivisorFromTask = maxDivisors;
        intWithMaxFromTask = whichInt;
    }
}</pre>


<p>The big idea when using a thread pool and load balancing is to divide up the overall
problem into a fairly large number of fairly small (but not too small) subtasks.  In my program, each
task is assigned a range of 1000 integers to work on.  Since there are 100000 integers
in the overall problem, there will be 100 subtasks.  The question of how big the subtasks
should be does not have a definite answer, but this choice seemed to work well, since the
work was divided pretty evenly among the processors.</p>


<p>Once the tasks have been created and the threads have been started, 
the main thread has to collect and process all the results from the tasks.
As each task completes, it places its result into the result queue.
A result can be removed from the queue by calling <span class="code">resultQueue.take()</span>,
which will block if the queue is empty until a result becomes available.
So the for loop that processes results won't be able to complete until all the tasks have
been completed and all the threads have terminated:
</p>


<pre>int maxDivisorCount = 0;         // Overall maximum found by any task.
int intWithMaxDivisorCount = 0;  // Which integer gave that maximum?
for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberOfTasks; i++) {
    try {
        Result result = resultQueue.take();
        if (result.maxDivisorFromTask &gt; maxDivisorCount) { // new maximum.
            maxDivisorCount = result.maxDivisorFromTask;
            intWithMaxDivisorCount = result.intWithMaxFromTask;
        }
    }
    catch (InterruptedException e) { // Won't happen in this program!
    }
}</pre>


<p>Once the for loop ends, the final answers, taking into account the results
from every thread, are in the variables <span class="code">maxDivisorCount</span>
and <span class="code">intWithMaxDivisorCount</span>.</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>My solution uses a <span class="classname">ConcurrentLinkedQueue</span> for the
task queue.  This is a little touchy, since we have to be careful not
to start the threads until the tasks are in the queue.  This is because
the threads are programmed to terminate as soon as they see an empty queue:</p>


<pre>private static class CountDivisorsThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        while (true) {
            Task task = taskQueue.poll();
            if (task == null)
                break; // queue is empty; terminate
            task.compute();
        }
    }
}</pre>


<p>If the queue is empty when the thread starts, it will terminate
immediately.  Furthermore, terminating the threads after the job is
done is fine in this program, but often when we use a thread pool,
we want to keep the threads around to work on more than one job.</p>


<p>One solution is to use a <span class="classname">LinkedBlockingQueue</span>
for the task queue, instead of a <span class="classname">ConcurrentLinkedQueue</span>.
When a blocking queue is faced with an empty queue, it waits for an item
to become available in the queue.  We can then start the queue whenever
we want, and the threads will wait, if necessary, for tasks to be added
to the queue.  If we had more jobs for the thread pool, the threads would
just wait around between jobs and would become active again as soon as
tasks from a new job are enqueued.  Here is a version of the thread
class that will work with a blocking queue of tasks:
</p>


<pre>private static class CountDivisorsThread extends Thread {
    CountDivisorsThread() {
        try {
            setDaemon(true);
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
        }
    }
    public void run() {
        while (true) {
            try {
                Task task = blockingTaskQueue.take();
                task.compute();
            }
            catch (InterruptedException e) {
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>


<p>Note that I've made the thread into a daemon thread.  This will allow the Java
Virtual Machine to exit, even though the thread still exists, as long as all the
non-daemon threads have exited.  For this exercise, if the threads were not
daemon threads, the program would not actually end after completing the job,
since the non-daemon thread-pool threads would still be around.  (However,
you could still make the program end by calling <span class="code">System.exit()</span>.)</p>
