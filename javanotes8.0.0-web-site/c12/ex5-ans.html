<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 12.5</h2>
<hr class="break">
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 12.5:</h3>
<p>In <a href="../c11/ex3-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;11.3</a>, you wrote a network server program
that can send text files from a specified directory to clients.  That program used
a single thread, which handled all the communication with each client.  Modify the
program to turn it into a multithreaded server.  Use a thread pool of
connection-handling threads and use an <span class="classname">ArrayBlockingQueue</span>
to get connected sockets from the <span class="code">main()</span> routine to the threads.
The sample program <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter12/DateServerWithThreads.java">DateServerWithThreads.java</a></span> from <a href="../c12/s4.html#threads.4.3">Subsection&nbsp;12.4.3</a>
is an example of a multithreaded server that works in this way.
Your server program will work with the same client program as the
original server.  You wrote the client program as the solution to 
<a href="../c11/ex4-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;11.4</a>.</p>

<p>This is not a difficult exercise, given the model in 
<span class="code">DateServerWithThreads.java</span>.   My solution to
<a href="../c11/ex3-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;11.3</a>, <span class="code">FileServer,java</span>, already has a method</p>

<pre>private static void handleConnection(File directory, Socket connection)</pre>

<p>to handle a connection with one client.  
The connection in this method is represented by a <span class="classname">Socket</span>.
The <span class="classname">File</span> in this method represents the directory that 
contains the file server's files; it is set at the beginning of the program
and does not change after that.  The only thing that we have to send
from the main program to the connection-handling threads is
the socket that represents a given connection.  So, the queue can be a 
queue of <span class="classname">Sockets</span>:</p>

<pre>private static ArrayBlockingQueue&lt;Socket&gt; connectionQueue;</pre>

<p>A connection-handling thread runs in an infinite loop in which it 
takes a socket from this queue and uses it to communicate with the client.
I could have moved the code from the <span class="code">handleConnection()</span>
method into the run method of the thread, but I decided it would be 
easier to have the <span class="code">run()</span> method call the method that
already exists.  I also need to pass the directory to the 
<span class="code">handleConnection()</span> method, so the thread needs some
way of knowing the directory.  I pass the directory to the thread
in the thread's constructor.  (An alternative would have been to
make it a global variable, as I did for the queue.)  Here is
the class that defines the connection-handling threads:</p>

<pre>private static class ConnectionHandler extends Thread {
    File directory;  // The directory that contains the files
                     // that are made available on this server.
    ConnectionHandler(File directory) {
        this.directory = directory;
        setDaemon(true);
    }
    public void run() {
        while (true) {
            try {
                Socket connection = connectionQueue.take();
                handleConnection(directory,connection);
            }
            catch (Exception e) {
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>

<p>The main program creates and starts several threads belonging to this
class, before it starts listening for connection requests.  Other changes
are straightforward.  You can see the details in the complete solution,
given below.</p>

/**
 * This program is a very simple network file server.  The 
 * server has a list of available text files that can be
 * downloaded by the client.  The client can also download
 * the list of files.  When the connection is opened, the
 * client sends one of two possible commands to the server:
 * "index" or "get &lt;file-name&gt;".  The server replies to
 * the first command by sending the list of available files.
 * It responds to the second with a one-line message,
 * either "ok" or "error".  If the message is "ok", it is
 * followed by the contents of the file with the specified
 * name.  The "error" message indicates that the specified
 * file does not exist on the server. (The server can also
 * respond with the message "unknown command" if the command
 * it reads is not one of the two possible legal commands.)
 * 
 * The server program requires a command-line parameter
 * that specifies the directory that contains the files
 * that the server can serve.  The files should all be
 * text files, but this is not checked.  Also, the server
 * must have permission to read all the files.
 * 
 <span class="newcode">* This version of the program defines a multithreaded
 * server that uses a thread pool.  The threads handle
 * all communication with the clients.  The main program
 * simply accepts connections and puts them into a queue.
 * The connection-handling threads in the thread pool remove
 * connections from the queue as they become available.</span>
