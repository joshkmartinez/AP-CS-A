<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 12.2</h2>
<hr class="break">

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 12.2:</h3>
<p>
<a href="../c3/ex2-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;3.2</a> asked
you to find the integer in the range 1 to 10000 that has the largest
number of divisors.  Now write a program that uses multiple threads to
solve the same problem, but for the range 1 to 100000.  By using threads, 
your program will take less time
to do the computation when it is run on a multiprocessor computer.
At the end of the program, output the elapsed time, the integer that
has the largest number of divisors, and the number of divisors that it has.
The program can be modeled on the sample prime-counting program 
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter12/ThreadTest2.java">ThreadTest2.java</a></span> from <a href="../c12/s1.html#threads.1.3">Subsection&nbsp;12.1.3</a>.
For this exercise, you should simply divide up the problem into parts
and create one thread to do each part.</p>

<hr>
<div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr>

<p>Pseudocode for solving this problem without using threads is:</p>

<pre>maxDivisors = 0    // Maximum number of divisors seen so far
for N from 1 to 100000:
   Let count be the number of divisors of N
   if (count &gt; maxDivisors):
      maxDivisors = count  // New maximum number of divisors
      whichInt = N         // The integer that gave the maximum</pre>

<p>To turn this into a multithreaded program, we have to divide the
integers between 1 and 100000 into groups and assign each group of integers
to a thread.  In its run method, each thread finds the maximum number of
divisors for integers in its assigned group.  This is very similar to what
was done in the prime-counting program <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter12/ThreadTest2.java">ThreadTest2.java</a></span>.
The only problem is combining the final results of all the threads.
In <span class="code">ThreadTest2.java</span>, each thread counted some primes and
recorded its results by calling a method</p>

<pre>synchronized private static void addToTotal(int x)</pre>

<p>We can do something similar here.  The thread actually has two
pieces of data to report, the maximum number of divisors that it
found and the integer that had that many divisors.  The data from
the thread has to be combined with the overall information about the
maximum found by any thread so far.  So, the reporting method
becomes:</p>

<pre>/**
 * This method is called by a thread when it has completed its computation,
 * to report the largest number of divisors that it found in its assigned
 * range of integers.  The information is used to update the variables
 * maxDivisorCount and intWithMaxDivisorCount.
 * @param maxCountFromThread largest divisor count in the thread's assigned
 *          range
 * @param intWithMaxFromThread the integer that had the maximum number
 *          of divisors
 */
synchronized private static void report(int maxCountFromThread, 
         int intWithMaxFromThread) {
   if (maxCountFromThread &gt; maxDivisorCount) {
      maxDivisorCount = maxCountFromThread;
      intWithMaxDivisorCount = intWithMaxFromThread;
   }
}</pre>

<p>The class that defines the threads, <span class="classname">CountDivisorsThread</span>,
is very similar to the thread class from <span class="code">ThreadTest2.java</span>.  You can
see it in the complete solution below.</p>

<p>In the program <span class="code">ThreadTest2.java</span>, the number of integers to be
processed was chosen to be evenly divisible by the number of threads.  This made
it easier to divide the integers among the threads, since every thread can
be assigned exactly the same number of integers to process.  For this program,
I decided to drop the assumption that the number of integers is divisible by
the number of threads.  This makes the program more general, but it's a little
harder to decide how to assign the integers to the threads.</p>

<p>If there are <span class="code">T</span> threads and <span class="code">N</span> integers, then
each thread gets at least <span class="code">N/T</span> integers (where <span class="code">N/T</span>
means the integer quotient, discarding any remainder).  But after assigning
<span class="code">N/T</span> integers to each thread, there might still be a few integers
left over.  (The number of leftovers is actually <span class="code">N&nbsp;%&nbsp;T</span>.)
In my program, I just add these extra integers onto the group of integers
assigned to the last thread, so the last thread might have more integers to
process than the other threads.  I do this by making sure that the last number
assigned to the last thread is 100000.)</p>

<pre>int integersPerThread = 100000/numberOfThreads; 
int start = 1;  // Starting point of the range of ints for first thread.
int end = start + integersPerThread - 1;   // End point of the range of ints.
for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberOfThreads; i++) {
   if (i == numberOfThreads - 1) {
      end = 100000;  // Make sure that the last thread's range goes all
                     // the way up to 100000.  Because of rounding, this
                     // is not automatic.
   }
   worker[i] = new CountDivisorsThread( start, end );
   start = end+1;    // Determine the range of ints for the NEXT thread.
   end = start + integersPerThread - 1;
}</pre>

<p>As one final change, instead of using the literal number 100000 as the number of
integers to be processed in my program, I use a constant named <span class="code">MAX</span>
to make it easier to change the range of integers that is considered.</p>
