<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 12.4</h2>
<hr class="break">
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 12.4:</h3>
<p> In <a href="../c12/ex3-ans.html">previous exercise</a>, you used
a thread pool and a queue of tasks to find the integer in the range 1 to 100000 that has the
largest number of divisors.  <a href="../c12/s3.html#threads.3.3a">Subsection&nbsp;12.3.4</a> discusses a higher-level
approach that uses an <span class="classname">ExecutorService</span>.  
Write one more program to solve the problem, this time using an <span class="classname">ExecutorService</span>
and <span class="classname">Futures</span>. The program should still break up the computation into
a fairly large number of fairly small tasks, and it should still print out the largest number
of divisors and the integer that has that number of divisors.</p>

<p>(There is yet another way to solve the same problem: the stream API from <a href="../c10/s6.html">Section&nbsp;10.6</a>.
My solution using the stream API, however, uses an aspect of the stream API that I did not
cover: the interface <span class="classname">Optional&lt;T&gt;</span>. My solution of this exercise
also discusses how to use streams to solve the problem.)</p>

<p>My solution to <a href="../c12/ex3-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;12.3</a> used nested classes
<span class="classname">Task</span> and <span class="classname">Result</span> to represent one of the subtasks
in the problem and the result from a subclass.  For this problem, we want to submit the
tasks to an <span class="classname">ExecutorService</span>, so we need tasks that implement the
<span class="classname">Callable</span> interface.  The tasks compute outputs of type <span class="classname">Result</span>,
so in fact, <span class="classname">Task</span> implements <span class="atype">Callable&lt;Result&gt;</span>.
Here are the two classes, with changes to <span class="classname">Task</span> shown in red:</p>


<pre>/**
 * A class to represent the result from one task.  The
 * result consists of the maximum number of divisors in
 * the range of integers assigned to that task, and the
 * integer in the range that gave the maximum number of
 * divisors.
 */
private static class Result {
    int maxDivisorFromTask;  // Maximum number of divisors found.
    int intWithMaxFromTask;  // Which integer gave that maximum number.
    Result(int maxDivisors, int whichInt) {
        maxDivisorFromTask = maxDivisors;
        intWithMaxFromTask = whichInt;
    }
}


/**
 * A class to represent the task of finding the number in
 * a given range of integers that has the largest number of
 * divisors.  The range is specified in the constructor.
 <span class="newcode">* The task is executed when the call() method is 
 * called.  At the end of the call() method, a Result
 * object is created to represent the results from this
 * task, and the result object is returned as the value
 * of call().</span>
 */
private static class Task <span class="newcode">implements Callable&lt;Result&gt;</span>{
    int min, max; // Start and end of the range of integers for this task.
    Task(int min, int max) {
        this.min = min;
        this.max = max;
    }
    public <span class="newcode">Result call()</span> {
        int maxDivisors = 0;
        int whichInt = 0;
        for (int i = min; i &lt; max; i++) {
            int divisors = countDivisors(i);
            if (divisors &gt; maxDivisors) {
                maxDivisors = divisors;
                whichInt = i;
            }
        }
        <span class="newcode">return new Result(maxDivisors,whichInt);</span>
    }
}</pre>


<p>Following the example of <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter12/ThreadTest4.java">ThreadTest4.java</a></span>, we can perform
the computation by creating an <span class="classname">ExecutorService</span> and
submitting the tasks to it.  When a task it submitted, an object of type
<span class="atype">Future&lt;Result&gt;</span> is returned, representing the future
result of the computation.  The program needs to save those <span class="classname">Futures</span>
in a list:</p>


<pre>ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numberOfThreads);
ArrayList&lt;Future&lt;Result&gt;&gt; results = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();

int numberOfTasks = (MAX + 999) / 1000;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberOfTasks; i++) {
    int start = i*1000 + 1;
    int end = (i+1)*1000;
    if (end &gt; MAX)
        end = MAX;
    //System.out.println(start + " " + end);  // for testing
    Future&lt;Result&gt; res = executor.submit( new Task(start,end) );
    results.add(res);
}</pre>


<p>After submitting all the tasks, the program can get the results from
the <span class="classname">Futures</span>.  Note that calling a Future's <span class="code">get()</span>
method will block until the result is actually available (or an error occurs):</p>
        

<pre>int maxDivisorCount = 0;         // Over maximum found by any task.
int intWithMaxDivisorCount = 0;  // Which integer gave that maximum?
for (Future&lt;Result&gt; res : results) {
    try {
        Result result = res.get();
        if (result.maxDivisorFromTask &gt; maxDivisorCount) { // new maximum.
            maxDivisorCount = result.maxDivisorFromTask;
            intWithMaxDivisorCount = result.intWithMaxFromTask;
        }
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println("An unexpected error occurred! Error:");
        System.out.println(e);
        System.exit(1);
    }
}</pre>


<p>In my testing, this version of the solution to the divisors program took about 
the same amount of time as the solution that implemented thread pools directly.</p>


<p>As a final note, <span class="code">executor.shutdown()</span> needs to be called at
some point after all the tasks have been submitted. Otherwise, the program
won't actually end when <span class="code">main()</span> finishes, since the non-daemon
threads in the executor's thread pool will still exist. Alternatively,
<span class="code">System.exit()</span> could be called to definitively end the program.</p>


<hr class="break">

<p>There is yet another way to solve the "count divisors" problem: using the
stream API.  The same <span class="classname">Task</span> and <span class="classname">Result</span>
classes that were used in the <span class="classname">ExectorService</span> approach
can also be used with streams (although <span class="classname">Task</span> no
longer needs to implement <span class="classname">Callable</span>).</p>


<p>The algorithm goes like this:  Create an <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;Task&gt;</span>
containing all of the tasks that make up the problem.  Obtain a <span class="code">parallelStream</span>
from that list.  Apply a <span class="code">mapping</span> operation to the stream,
where each task is mapped to the result that is output from that task.
(This is where all of the work of counting is done.)  This converts the
stream of <span class="classname">Tasks</span> into a stream of <span class="classname">Results</span>.
Finally, we need to find the result with the largest number of divisors.  That can be done
by applying the <span class="code">max()</span> operator to the stream.  The <span class="code">max()</span> operator
takes a parameter that is the <span class="classname">Comparator</span> that it will use to
compare two objects from the stream.  So, starting from the <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>,
<span class="code">tasks</span>, the computation can be done as follows:</p>


<pre>tasks.parallelStream()
     .map( task -&gt; task.call() )
     .max( (r1,r2) -&gt; r1.maxDivisorFromTask - r2.maxDivisorFromTask );</pre>
     

<p>This computation returns the result that contains the largest <span class="code">maxDivisorFromTask</span>.
Unfortunately, it returns the answer as a value of type <span class="atype">Optional&lt;Result&gt;</span>.
An <span class="classname">Optional</span> represents a value that might or might not exists.
If <span class="code">opt</span> is an <span class="classname">Optional</span>, then the <span class="ptype">boolean</span>-valued
function <span class="code">opt.isPresent()</span> is used to test whether the value exists.  The actual
value can be retrieved by calling <span class="code">opt.get()</span>, which will throw an exception if
the value does not exist.  The reason <span class="code">max()</span> returns an <span class="classname">Optional</span>
is that an empty stream does not have a maximum, so no value will be present in that case.
For this problem, we know that the maximum exists, so we can call <span class="code">get()</span>
without checking whether the value is present.  Here is a <span class="code">main()</span> program that
uses the stream API to solve the divisors problem:</p>


<pre>public static void main(String[] args) {
    long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
    ArrayList&lt;Task&gt; tasks = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    int numberOfTasks = (MAX + 999) / 1000;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberOfTasks; i++) {
        int start = i*1000 + 1;
        int end = (i+1)*1000;
        if (end &gt; MAX)
            end = MAX;
        tasks.add( new Task(start,end) );
    }
    Optional&lt;Result&gt; max;
    max = tasks.parallelStream()
           .map( task -&gt; task.call() )
           .max( (r1,r2) -&gt; r1.maxDivisorFromTask - r2.maxDivisorFromTask);
    Result bestRes = max.get();
    long elapsedTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime;
    System.out.println("\nThe largest number of divisors " + 
            "for numbers between 1 and " + MAX + 
            " is " + bestRes.maxDivisorFromTask);
    System.out.println("An integer with that many divisors is " + 
            bestRes.intWithMaxFromTask);
    System.out.println("Total elapsed time:  " + 
            (elapsedTime/1000.0) + " seconds.\n");
}</pre>


<p>In my testing, this version of the solution took about 12% more time than the
<span class="classname">ExecutorService</span> solution or the version that implemented
a thread pool directly.</p>
