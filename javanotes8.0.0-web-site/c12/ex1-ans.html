<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 12.1:</h3>
<p>
<a href="../c12/s1.html#threads.1.3">Subsection&nbsp;12.1.3</a> discusses the need for synchronization
in multithreaded programs, and it defines a <span class="classname">ThreadSafeCounter</span> class with
the necessary synchronization.  Is this really important?  Can you really get errors
by using an unsynchronized counter with multiple threads?  Write a program to find out.
Use the following unsynchronized counter class, which you can include as a nested class in
your program:</p>

<pre>static class Counter {
    int count;
    void inc() {
        count = count+1;
    }
    int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}</pre>

<p>Write a thread class that will repeatedly call the <span class="code">inc()</span> method in an
object of type <span class="classname">Counter</span>.  The object should be a shared
global variable. Create several threads, start them all, and wait for all
the threads to terminate.  Print the final value of the counter, and see whether it
is correct.</p>

<p>Let the user enter the number of threads and the number of times that each thread
will increment the counter.  You might need a fairly large number of increments to
see an error.  And of course there can never be any error if you use just one
thread.  Your program can use <span class="code">join()</span> to wait for a thread to
terminate (see <a href="../c12/s1.html#threads.1.2">Subsection&nbsp;12.1.2</a>).</p>

<p>The necessary thread class is very simple to write.  In my
program, it's a static nested class that uses two global variables, which
represent the counter and the number of times that the thread is to increment
the counter:</p>

<pre>static Counter counter;          // The counter that will be incremented.
static int numberOfIncrements;   // Number of times each thread will increment it.

static class IncrementerThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberOfIncrements; i++) {
            counter.inc();
        }
    }
}</pre>

<p>Note that since the counter is a global static variable, it is used by
all threads of type <span class="classname">IncrementerThread</span>.  It is a shared
resource.</p>

<p>In the <span class="code">main()</span> routine, after getting the number of threads and
the number of increments from the user, we need to create the threads, start them,
and wait for them to terminate.  We have to do the part about starting all the
threads before we get to the part about waiting for threads to terminate, so
we need an array to hold the threads:</p>

<pre>IncrementerThread[] workers = new IncrementerThread[numberOfThreads];
counter = new Counter();
for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberOfThreads; i++)
    workers[i] = new IncrementerThread();
for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberOfThreads; i++)
    workers[i].start();

/* Wait for all threads to terminate. */

for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberOfThreads; i++) {
    try {
        workers[i].join();
    }
    catch (InterruptedException e) {
    }
}</pre>

<p>(I hope that it's clear that you can't start a thread, wait for it to finish,
start another thread, wait for it to finish, and so on.  If you did that, you'd only
have one thread running at any given time, and you would certainly not see any
errors in the counter!)</p>

<p>My program actually runs in a loop, so the user can run several experiments
without restarting the program every time.</p>

<p>In my own experiments, I saw a lot of errors when the number of increments per
thread was one million, even with just two threads.  For small numbers of increments, less than about 1000, I never
saw any errors. (This might be because the threads didn't run long enough to actually
get more than one running at a time.)  I saw a few errors when I used a large number
of threads with 1000 increments per thread.</p>

<p>Making <span class="code">inc()</span> into a synchronized method completely solves the problem.
If you try that, you should find that the program takes noticeably longer to run, because
of the extra overhead associated with the synchronization.  Simply declaring the
variable <span class="code">count</span> to be <span class="code">volatile</span> does <b>not</b> fix the
problem, since the race condition still exists. (In fact, curiously, I found that the
number of errors increased when I made <span class="code">count</span> <span class="code">volatile</span>, possibly because
accessing the volatile variable can cause a thread to block briefly and give another 
thread the chance to jump in.)</p>

<p>This exercise shows that synchronization errors can happen.  In many programs,
they would be very rare, but serious when they occur.  Unfortunately, when trying to
track down a bug that is due to a synchronization error, it might be very difficult
to reproduce the error, since such errors depend on accidents of timing between
two threads that are running independently.  This makes it all the more important to
analyze your program carefully and get it right when you are writing it in the first place, 
rather than count on your ability to debug it later.</p>
