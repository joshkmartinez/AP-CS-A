<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 2.5:</h3>
<p>If you have <span class="code">N</span>
eggs, then you have <span class="code">N/12</span> dozen eggs, with <span class="code">N%12</span> eggs left
over. (This is essentially the definition of the <span class="code">/</span> and <span class="code">%</span>
operators for integers.) Write a program that asks the user how many eggs she
has and then tells the user how many dozen eggs she has and how many extra eggs
are left over.</p>

<p>A gross of eggs is equal to 144 eggs. Extend your program so that it will
tell the user how many gross, how many dozen, and how many left over eggs she
has. For example, if the user says that she has 1342 eggs, then your program
would respond with</p>


<pre>Your number of eggs is 9 gross, 3 dozen, and 10</pre>


<p>since 1342 is equal to 9*144 + 3*12 + 10.</p>

<p>All the variables for the program will be of type <span class="ptype">int</span>. The
quantities that we have to represent are: the number of eggs, the number of
dozens in that many eggs, and the number of left over eggs. I will declare
variables named <span class="code">eggs</span>, <span class="code">dozens</span>, and <span class="code">extras</span> to
represent these quantities.</p>


<p>The number of eggs can be read from the user's input using <span class="code">eggs =
TextIO.getlnInt()</span>.</p>


<p>The description of the problem already tells us that <span class="code">dozens</span> can be
computed as <span class="code">eggs/12</span> and <span class="code">extras</span> can be computed as
<span class="code">eggs%12</span>. So, the first version of the program is easy to write.
Note that the entire output from this program could have been done with
one <span class="code">System.out.printf</span>:</p>


<pre>System.out.print("Your number of eggs is %d dozen and %d extras%n", 
                                 dozens, extras);</pre>


<p>The improved version requires a little thought. Given a pile of eggs that
you want to divide into gross, dozens, and extras, you could first remove as
many gross as possible, leaving a pile of between 0 and 143 eggs. This is just
like dividing the pile into dozens, except that the unit of measure is 144 eggs
instead of 12. So, <span class="code">eggs/144</span> will give the number of gross, and
<span class="code">eggs%144</span> is the number of eggs left over. Next, the eggs in the left-over
pile still have to be divided into dozens, plus some extra number of eggs
between 0 and 11. Of course, we already know how to do this: If there are
<span class="code">N</span> eggs in the pile, the number of dozens is <span class="code">N/12</span> and the
number of extra eggs is <span class="code">N%12</span>. This leads to the computation in the
improved version of the program, shown below. (Note that this program uses the
variable named <span class="code">aboveGross</span> to represent a quantity that is not
mentioned explicitly in the problem description. This is far from being
unusual.)</p>
