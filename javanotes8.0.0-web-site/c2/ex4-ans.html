<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 2.4:</h3>
<p>Write a program that helps
the user count his change. The program should ask how many quarters the user
has, then how many dimes, then how many nickels, then how many pennies. Then
the program should tell the user how much money he has, expressed in
dollars.</p>

<p>The program will need variables to represent the number of each type of
coin. Since the number of coins has to be an integer, these variables are of
type <span class="ptype">int</span>. I'll call the variables <span class="code">quarters</span>, <span class="code">dimes</span>,
<span class="code">nickels</span>, and <span class="code">pennies</span>.</p>


<p>The total value of the coins, when expressed in dollars, can be a
non-integer number such as 1.57 or 3.02. Since the total value in dollars is a
real number, I will use a variable of type <span class="ptype">double</span> to represent it. The
variable is named <span class="code">dollars</span>
</p>


<p>The outline of the program is clear enough:</p>


<pre>Declare the variables.
Ask the user for the number of each type of coin, and read the responses.
Compute the total value of the coins, in dollars.
Display the result to the user.</pre>


<p>The function <span class="code">TextIO.getlnInt()</span> can be used to read each of the
user's responses. The alternative function <span class="code">TextIO.getInt()</span> could also
be used, but it is less safe. Suppose, for example, that the user responds to
the request to type in the number of quarters by entering "7 quarters". After
<span class="code">TextIO.getlnInt()</span> reads the number 7, it will discard the extra input
"quarters". <span class="code">TextIO.getInt()</span> will read the 7 correctly, but the extra
input is not discarded. Later, when the program tries to read the number of
dimes, it sees the left-over input and tries to read that, without giving the
user a chance to type in another response. You might want to experiment and see
what happens if you change <span class="code">getlnInt()</span> to <span class="code">getInt()</span>. (Of
course, if the user's response is "I have 7 quarters" or "seven", then you are
out of luck in any case.)</p>


<p>Since one quarter is worth 0.25 dollars, the number of dollars in N quarters
is 0.25*N. Similarly, a dime is worth 0.10 dollars, a nickel is 0.05 dollars,
and a penny is 0.01 dollars. So, to get the total value of all the user's
coins, I just have to add up <span class="code">(0.25*quarters) + (0.10*dimes) +
(0.05*nickels) + (0.01*pennies)</span>. This value is assigned to the variable,
<span class="code">dollars</span>, and that is the result that is displayed to the user.
Formatted output, using <span class="code">System.out.printf</span>,
can be used to specify that the output value should be printed with two
digits after the decimal point.</p>


<p>Alternatively, I could first have computed the total number of cents in all
the coins, and then divided by 100 to convert the amount into dollars:</p>


<pre>int totalCents;   // Total number of cents in the coins.

totalCents = 25*quarters + 10*dimes + 5*nickels + pennies;
dollars = totalCents/100.0;</pre>


<p>Since <span class="code">totalCents</span> is of type <span class="ptype">int</span>, it is essential here that
I compute <span class="code">dollars</span> as <span class="code">totalCents/100.0</span> and not as
<span class="code">totalCents/100</span>. The value computed by <span class="code">totalCents/100</span> is an
integer. For example, if <span class="code">totalCents</span> is 397, then
<span class="code">totalCents/100</span> is 3. Using <span class="code">totalCents/100.0</span> forces the
computer to compute the answer as a real number, giving 3.97.</p>


<p>A second version of the program, using a <span class="classname">Scanner</span> for input,
is also given.  (See <a href="../c2/s4.html#basics.4.6">Subsection&nbsp;2.4.6</a>.)  A <span class="classname">Scanner</span>
named <span class="code">stdio</span> is created, and integers are read using the function
<span class="code">stdio.nextInt()</span>.  This method corresponds to <span class="code">TextIO.getInt()</span>,
not <span class="code">TextIO.getlnInt()</span>.  To get something equivalent to <span class="code">TextIO.getlnInt()</span>,
we can follow the call to <span class="code">stdio.nextInt()</span> with a call to <span class="code">stdio.nextLine()</span>.
The call to <span class="code">stdio.nextLine()</span> will read and discard any extra characters on the
same line after the integer that was read by <span class="code">stdio.nextInt()</span>.  If you are not
worried about the user typing extra stuff on a line, you can leave out the calls to
<span class="code">stdio.nextInt()</span>.</p>
