<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 2.2:</h3>
<p> Write a program that
simulates rolling a pair of dice. You can simulate rolling one die by choosing
one of the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 at random. The number you pick
represents the number on the die after it is rolled. As pointed out in <a href="../c2/s5.html">Section&nbsp;2.5</a>, the expression</p>


<pre>(int)(Math.random()*6) + 1</pre>


<p>does the computation to select a random integer between 1 and 6.
You can assign this value to a variable to represent one of the dice that are
being rolled. Do this twice and add the results together to get the total roll.
Your program should report the number showing on each die as well as the total
roll. For example:</p>


<pre>The first die comes up 3
The second die comes up 5
Your total roll is 8</pre>

<p>When designing a program, one of the first things you should ask yourself
is, "What values do I need to represent?" The answer helps you decide what
variables to declare in the program. This program will need some variables to
represent the numbers showing on each die and the total of the two dice. Since
these numbers are all integers, we can use three variables of type
<span class="ptype">int</span>. I'll call the variables <span class="code">die1</span>, <span class="code">die2</span>, and
<span class="code">roll</span>. The program begins by declaring the variables:</p>


<pre>int die1;
int die2;
int roll;</pre>


<p>In the actual program, of course, I've added a comment to explain the
purpose of each variable. The values of <span class="code">die1</span> and <span class="code">die2</span> can be
computed using the expression given in the exercise:</p>


<pre>die1 = (int)(Math.random()*6) + 1;
die2 = (int)(Math.random()*6) + 1;</pre>


<p>Note that even though the expressions on the right-hand sides of these
assignment statements are the same, the values can be different because the
function <span class="code">Math.random()</span> can return different values when it is called
twice.</p>


<p>We can then compute <span class="code">roll = die1 + die2</span> and use three
<span class="code">System.out.println</span> statements to display the three lines of
output:</p>


<pre>System.out.println("The first die comes up " + die1);
System.out.println("The second die comes up " + die2);
System.out.println("Your total roll is " + roll);</pre>


<p>Note that I've chosen to use the concatenation operator, <span class="code">+</span>, to
append the value of <span class="code">die1</span> onto the string "The first die comes up".
Alternatively, I could use two output statements:</p>


<pre>System.out.print("The first die comes up ");
System.out.println(die1);</pre>


<p>Yet another possibility is to use <span class="code">System.out.printf</span>:</p>


<pre>System.out.printf("The first die comes up %d%n", die1);</pre>


<p>I'll also note that I could get away without the variable <span class="code">roll</span>,
since I could output the value of the expression <span class="code">die1 + die2</span>
directly:</p>


<pre>System.out.println("Your total roll is " + (die1 + die2));</pre>


<p>However, it's generally better style to have a meaningful name for a
quantity. By the way, the parentheses around <span class="code">(die1 + die2)</span> are
essential because of the precedence rules for the <span class="code">+</span> operator. You
might try to experiment with leaving them out and see what happens.</p>
