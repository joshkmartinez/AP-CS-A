<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 2.3:</h3>
<p>Write a program that asks
the user's name, and then greets the user by name. Before outputting the user's
name, convert it to upper case letters. For example, if the user's name is
Fred, then the program should respond "Hello, FRED, nice to meet you!".</p>

<p>In order to read the name typed in by the user, this program uses one of the
input routines from the non-standard <span class="classname">TextIO</span> class. So, this program
can only be run if that class is available to the program, and the program should
start with the import directive <span class="code">import textio.TextIO</span>.
I will use <span class="code">System.out</span>
for output.  (Although it is possible to use <span class="code">TextIO</span> for output as
well as for input, I will generally avoid that option in my examples.)</p>


<p>A name is a sequence of characters, so it is a value of type
<span class="classname">String</span>. The program must declare a variable of type <span class="classname">String</span> to
hold the user's name. I declare another variable to hold the user's name with
all the letters in the name converted to upper case. The conversion might be
difficult, except that <span class="classname">String</span> objects have a function that lets you do the
conversion with one line of code. If <span class="code">usersName</span> is the variable that refers to the name that
the user enters, then the function call <span class="code">usersName.toUpperCase()</span>
returns the string obtained by replacing any lower case letters in the name
with upper case letters.</p>


<p>There are several functions in the <span class="classname">TextIO</span> class that can be used for
reading <span class="code">Strings</span>: <span class="code">getWord()</span>, <span class="code">getlnWord()</span>, and
<span class="code">getln()</span>. The first two routines only read a single word, so if the
user entered "David J. Eck", they would only read the first name, "David". The
<span class="code">getln()</span> routine will read the entire line, and so would get the whole
name. For this program, I use <span class="code">getln()</span>, but you might prefer to use just
the first name.</p>


<p>I also give a version of the program that uses the built-in
class <span class="classname">Scanner</span>, instead of <span class="classname">TextIO</span>, for
reading input from the user.  See <a href="../c2/s4.html#basics.4.6">Subsection&nbsp;2.4.6</a> for a discussion of
the <span class="classname">Scanner</span> class.  In the second version of the program,
a <span class="classname">Scanner</span> named <span class="code">stdin</span> is created, and
the user's input is read using the function <span class="code">stdin.nextLine()</span>, which
has essentially the same functionality as <span class="code">TextIO.getln()</span>.</p>


<p>(For this program, by the way, <span class="code">TextIO.getWord()</span> and <span class="code">TextIO.getlnWord()</span>
would be equivalent. They return the same value. The second version of the
routine, <span class="code">getlnWord()</span>, would then discard the rest of the user's line
of input. However, since this program is only doing one input operation, it
doesn't matter whether it's discarded. It would only matter when it came time
to read a second value from input.)</p>
