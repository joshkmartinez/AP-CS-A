<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> sample answers to the quiz on Chapter 2 of
           <a href="../index.html"><i>Introduction to Programming Using Java</i></a>.
           Note that generally, there are lots of correct answers to a given question.</p>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;1:</p>
<p>Briefly explain what is
meant by the <i>syntax</i> and the <i>semantics</i> of a programming language.
Give an example to illustrate the difference between a syntax error and a
semantics error.</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>The syntax of a language is its
grammar, and the semantics is its meaning. A program with a syntax error cannot
be compiled. A program with a semantic error can be compiled and run, but gives
an incorrect result. A missing semicolon in a program is an example of a syntax
error, because the compiler will find the error and report it. If <span class="code">N</span> is
an integer variable, then the statement "<span class="code">frac = 1/N;</span>" is probably an
error of semantics. The value of <span class="code">1/N</span> will be 0 for any <span class="code">N</span>
greater than 1. It's likely that the programmer meant to say
<span class="code">1.0/N</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;2:</p>
<p>What does the computer do
when it executes a variable declaration statement. Give an example.</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>A variable is a "box", or
location, in the computer's memory that has a name. The box holds a value of
some specified type. A variable declaration statement is a statement such
as</p>


<pre>int x;</pre>


<p>which creates the variable x. When the computer executes a variable
declaration, it creates the box in memory and associates a name (in this case,
x) with that box. Later in the program, that variable can be referred to by
name.</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;3:</p>
<p>What is a <i>type,</i> as
this term relates to programming?</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>A "type" represents a set of
possible values. When you specify that a variable has a certain type, you are
saying what values it can hold. When you say that an expression is of a certain
type, you are saying what values the expression can have. For example, to say
that a variable is of type <span class="ptype">int</span> says that integer values in a certain
range can be stored in that variable.</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;4:</p>
<p>One of the primitive types
in Java is <i>boolean.</i> What is the <span class="ptype">boolean</span> type? Where are boolean
values used? What are its possible values?</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>The only values of type boolean
are <span class="code">true</span> and <span class="code">false</span>. Expressions of type boolean are used in
places where true/false values are expected, such as the conditions in
<span class="code">while</span> loops and <span class="code">if</span> statements.</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;5:</p>
<p>Give the meaning of each of
the following Java operators:</p>


<pre>a)    ++

b)    &amp;&amp;

c)    !=</pre>

</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>The operator ++ is used to add 1
to the value of a variable. For example, "<span class="code">count++</span>" has the same effect
as "<span class="code">count = count + 1</span>".</p>

<p>The operator &amp;&amp; represents the word <b>and</b>. It can be used to
combine two boolean values, as in "<span class="code">(x&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;y&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0)</span>",
which means, "x is greater than 0 <b>and</b> y is greater than 0."</p>

<p>The operation != means "is not equal to", as in "<span class="code">if (x != 0)</span>",
meaning "if x is not equal to zero.".</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;6:</p>
<p>Explain what is meant by an
<i>assignment statement,</i> and give an example. What are assignment
statements used for?</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>An assignment statement computes
a value and stores that value in a variable. Examples include:</p>


<pre>x = 17;          // Assign a constant value to the variable, x.
newRow = row;    // Copy the value from the variable, row,
                 //             into the variable, newRow.
ans = 17*x + 42; // Compute the value of the expression 
                 //     17*x + 42, and store that value in ans.</pre>


<p>An assignment statement is used to change the value of a variable as the
program is running. Since the value assigned to the variable can be another
variable or an expression, assignments statements can be used to copy data from
one place to another in the computer, and to do complex computations.</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;7:</p>
<p>What is meant by
<i>precedence</i> of operators?</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>If two or more operators are
used in an expression, and if there are no parentheses to indicate the order in
which the operators are to be evaluated, then the computer needs some way of
deciding which operator to evaluate first. The order is determined by the
precedence of the operators. For example, <span class="code">*</span> has higher precedence than
<span class="code">+</span>, so the expression <span class="code">3+5*7</span> is evaluated as if it were written
<span class="code">3+(5*7)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;8:</p>
<p>What is a
<i>literal</i>?</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>A literal is a sequence of
characters used in a program to represent a constant value. For example,
<span class="code">'A'</span> is a literal that represents the value A, of type <span class="ptype">char</span>,
and <span class="code">17L</span> is a literal that represents the number 17 as a value of type
<span class="ptype">long</span>. A literal is a way of writing a value, and should not be
confused with the value itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;9:</p>
<p>In Java, classes have two
fundamentally different purposes. What are they?</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>A class can be used to group
together variables and subroutines that are contained in the class. These are
called the static members of the class. For example, the subroutine
<span class="code">Math.sqrt</span> is a static member of the class called <span class="classname">Math</span>. Also,
the <span class="code">main</span> routine in any program is a static member of a class. The
second possible purpose of a class is to describe and create objects. The class
specifies what variables and subroutines are contained in those objects. In
this role, classes are used in object-oriented programming (which we haven't
studied yet in any detail.)</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;10:</p>
<p>What is the difference
between the statement "<span class="code">x&nbsp;=&nbsp;TextIO.getDouble();</span>" and the statement
"<span class="code">x&nbsp;=&nbsp;TextIO.getlnDouble();</span>"</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>Either statement will read a
real number input by the user, and store that number in the variable, x. They
would both read and return exactly the same value. The difference is that in
the second statement (using <span class="code">getlnDouble</span>), after reading the value the
computer will continue reading characters from input up to and including the
next carriage return. These extra characters are discarded.</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;11:</p>
<p>Explain why the value of the expression <span class="code">2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;+&nbsp;"test"</span>
      is the string <span class="code">"5test"</span> while the value of the expression
      <span class="code">"test"&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3</span> is the string <span class="code">"test23"</span>.
      What is the value of <span class="code">"test"&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;*&nbsp;3</span>&nbsp;?</p>
   
</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>The reason is somewhat technical.
      The difference is due to the  order of evaluation.  When
      several <span class="code">+</span> operators are used in a row, with no parentheses, they
      are evaluated from left to right.
      <span class="code">2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;+&nbsp;"test"</span> is interpreted as
      <span class="code">(2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3)&nbsp;+&nbsp;"test"</span>, so 2 and 3 are
      added together, giving 5, and then the 5 is concatenated onto the string <span class="code">"test"</span>.
      On the other hand,  <span class="code">"test"&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3</span> is interpreted as
      <span class="code">("test"&nbsp;+&nbsp;2)&nbsp;+&nbsp;3</span>, so the 2 is first concatenated onto
      the <span class="code">"test"</span>, giving <span class="code">"test2"</span>, and then the 3 is concatenated
      onto that.  In the case of <span class="code">"test"&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;*&nbsp;3</span>, the precedence
      rules for <span class="code">+</span> and <span class="code">*</span> come into play.  Since <span class="code">*</span>
      has higher precedence, this expression is interpreted as
      <span class="code">"test"&nbsp;+&nbsp;(2&nbsp;*&nbsp;3)</span>, which evaluates to <span class="code">"test6"</span>.</p>
   
</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;12:</p>
<p>Integrated Development Environments such as Eclipse often use <span class="newword">syntax coloring</span>,
      which assigns various colors to the characters in a program to reflect the syntax of the language.
      A student notices that Eclipse colors the word <span class="classname">String</span> differently from 
      <span class="ptype">int</span>, <span class="ptype">double</span>, and <span class="ptype">boolean</span>.  The student asks why
      <span class="classname">String</span> should be a different color, since all these words are names of types.
      What's the answer to the student's question?
   </p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>(This was a real question from a real student.)</p>
      
<p>Although <span class="classname">String</span>, like <span class="ptype">int</span>, <span class="ptype">double</span>, and <span class="ptype">boolean</span>, is a type name,
      there is a fundamental difference between <span class="classname">String</span> and the other types.  <span class="classname">String</span>
      is the name of a <b>class</b>, while <span class="ptype">int</span>, <span class="ptype">double</span>, and <span class="ptype">boolean</span> are
      primitive types.  Eclipse colors all class names in the same way that it does <span class="classname">String</span>,
      and it uses a different color for the primitive types.  (Although the difference between classes and
      primitive types might not seem very important to you now, it really is an important distinction
      and it's reasonable for Eclipse to use different colors for the two concepts.)</p>

<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;13:</p>
<p>What is the purpose of an import directive, such as <span class="code">import textio.TextIO</span>
or <span class="code">import java.util.Scanner</span>?</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>The classes <span class="classname">TextIO</span> and <span class="classname">Scanner</span>
are defined inside "packages" named <span class="classname">textio</span> and <span class="classname">java.util</span>.
This means that you can't simply use the names "TextIO" or "Scanner" in a program and expect
the computer to know what those names mean.  To use those names in a program, they must be
imported from the relevant packages.
</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;14:</p>
<p>Write a complete program that asks the user to enter the number of "widgets" they
want to buy and the cost per widget.  The program should then output the total cost for all the
widgets.  Use <span class="code">System.out.printf</span> to print the cost, with two digits after the decimal
point.  You do not need to include any comments in the program.
</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>The number of widgets can be a variable of type <span class="ptype">int</span>, and the 
cost per widget and total coast can be variables of type <span class="ptype">double</span>.
Using <span class="classname">TextIO</span>, the program can be written:</p>

<pre>import textio.TextIO;
public class CostOfWidgets {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int numberOfWidgets;
        double costPerWidget;
        double totalCost;
        System.out.print("How many widgets do you want? ");
        numberOfWidgets = TextIO.getlnInt();
        System.out.print("How much does each widget cost? ");
        costPerWidget = TextIO.getlnDouble();
        totalCost = numberOfWidgets * costPerWidget;
        System.out.printf("The total cost is $%1.2f%n", totalCost);
    }
}</pre>

<p>Using <span class="classname">Scanner</span>, this would be:</p>

<pre>import java.util.Scanner;
public class CostOfWidgets {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int numberOfWidgets;
        double costPerWidget;
        double totalCost;
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("How many widgets do you want? ");
        numberOfWidgets = in.nextInt();
        System.out.print("How much does each widget cost? ");
        costPerWidget = in.nextDouble();
        totalCost = numberOfWidgets * costPerWidget;
        System.out.printf("The total cost is $%1.2f%n", totalCost);
    }
}</pre>
