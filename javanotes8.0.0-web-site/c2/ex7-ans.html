<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 2.7:</h3>
<p>Suppose that a file named "testdata.txt" contains the following information:
      The first line of the file is the name of a student.  Each of the next three
      lines contains an integer.  The integers are the student's scores on three
      exams.  Write a program that will read the information in the file
      and display (on standard output) a message that contains the name of
      the student and the student's average grade on the three exams.
      The average is obtained by adding up the individual exam grades and
      then dividing by the number of exams.
      </p>

<p>
<span class="classname">TextIO</span> can be used to read data from a file; this is discussed
      in <a href="../c2/s4.html#basics.4.4">Subsection&nbsp;2.4.4</a>.  To read data from a file named
      "testdata.txt", all you need to do is say <span class="code">TextIO.readFile("testdata.txt")</span>.
      From then on, the input functions in <span class="classname">TextIO</span> will read from the file
      instead of reading data typed in by the user.  (Note that this assumes that
      the file is in the same directory with the program.)  In this case, we
      can use <span class="code">TextIO.getln()</span> to read the student's name from the first
      line of the file, and then we can read the exam grades by calling
      <span class="code">TextIO.getln()</span> three times.</p>
      
<p>The average should be computed as a value of type double.  Don't forget
      that if you divide an integer by an integer in Java, the result is an integer
      and the remainder of the division is discarded.  To get the correct
      average in this case, the program divides the sum of the three grades by
      3.0 rather than by 3.
      </p>
      
<p>One final technicality is that simply outputting a <span class="ptype">double</span>
      value might print out something like 83.333333333333333.  By default, all
      significant digits in the number are output.  In this case, one digit
      after the decimal point is probably sufficient.  The program
      uses formatted output to achieve this:</p>
      
      
<pre>System.out.printf("The average grade for %s was %1.1f", name, average);</pre>
    
      
<p>The format string
      "The average grade for %s was %1.1f" is used
      to format the name and the average.  The name is substituted for the
      format specifier <span class="code">%s</span>, which means that the name is
      printed as a string, with no extra spaces.  The average is substituted
      for <span class="code">%1.1f</span>, which means that the average
      is printed as a floating point number with no extra spaces and with
      1 digit after the decimal point.</p>
      
<p>You might want to run this program with no data file, or with a
      data file that is not in the correct format, to see what happens.
      (The program will crash and print an error message.)</p>

<pre class="exercisecode">import textio.TextIO;

public class FindAverage {

   public static void main(String[] args) {

       String name;     // The student's name, from the first line of the file.
       int exam1, exam2, exam3;     // The student's grades on the three exams.
       double average;  // The average of the three exam grades.

       TextIO.readFile("testdata.txt");  // Read from the file.

       name = TextIO.getln();  // Reads the entire first line of the file.
       exam1 = TextIO.getlnInt();
       exam2 = TextIO.getlnInt();
       exam3 = TextIO.getlnInt();

       average = ( exam1 + exam2 + exam3 ) / 3.0;

       System.out.printf("The average grade for %s was %1.1f", name, average);
       System.out.println();
