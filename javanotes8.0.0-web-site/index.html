<big>W</big>ELCOME TO
         the Eighth Edition of <i>Introduction to Programming Using Java</i>,
         a free, on-line textbook on introductory
         programming, which uses Java as the language of instruction.  This book is directed
         mainly towards beginning programmers, although it might also be useful for experienced
         programmers who want to learn something about Java.  It is certainly not meant to
         provide complete coverage of the Java language.
        </p>
<p>The eighth edition requires Java 8 or higher, including JavaFX. 
         Earlier editions of the book are still available.  In particular,
         <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes7">the&nbsp;seventh&nbsp;edition</a> uses
         Swing instead of JavaFX. See the <a href="preface.html">preface</a> for links to
         all older editions.</p>
<p>You can the download this
         web site for use on your own computer. 
         PDF, <span style="white-space:pre">e-book</span>, and print
         versions of the textbook are also available.
         The PDF that includes links might be the best way to read it on your computer.
         <b>Links to the downloads can be found at the bottom of this page.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Readers are strongly encouraged to try out the <a href="source/index.html">sample&nbsp;programs</a> as they read
         the book!  You can download the source code separately or as part of the web site using the links below.
         See <a href="README-running-the-examples.txt">README&nbsp;file</a>
         for information about how to compile and run the examples.</b>

           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These should be considered experimental.  Depending on the particular ebook reader that you use,
           there can be problems with rendering of long lines in program code sample.  You might find that lines that are too long
           to fit across your screen are incorrectly split into multiple lines, or that the part that extends beyond the right
           margin is simply dropped.  On some readers, you might be able to scroll horizontally to see the hidden text.
           The ebooks include answers to quizzes
           and exercises but do not include source code for sample programs; the sample programs can be downloaded separately, above.
