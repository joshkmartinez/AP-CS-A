<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> sample answers to the quiz on Chapter 7 of
           <a href="../index.html"><i>Introduction to Programming Using Java</i></a>.
           Note that generally, there are lots of correct answers to a given question.</p>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;1:</p>
<p>What is meant by the <i>basetype</i> of an array?</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>The base type of an array refers
to the type of the items that can be stored in that array. For example, the
base type of the array of type <span class="atype">Color[]</span> is 
<span class="classname">Color</span>.</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;2:</p>
<p>What is the purpose of the following variable-arity method? What are
the values of <span class="code">same(1,2,3)</span>, <span class="code">same(17,17,17,17)</span>,
and <span class="code">same(2)</span>?  Why?</p>

<pre>static double same( int... value ) {
    for (int i = 1; i &lt; value.length; i++) {
        if ( value[i-1] != value[i] )
            return false;
    }
    return true;
}</pre>

</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>This function can be called with any number of integer parameters. It tests
whether all of the parameter values are equal.  The value of
<span class="code">same(1,2,3)</span> is <span class="code">false</span>.  The function begins by 
comparing 1 and 2; since they are not equal, it immediately returns <span class="code">false</span>.
The value of <span class="code">same(17,17,17,17)</span> is <span class="code">true</span>.  The function compares
<span class="code">value[0]</span> with <span class="code">value[1]</span>, <span class="code">value[1]</span> with <span class="code">value[2]</span>,
and <span class="code">value[2]</span> with <span class="code">value[3]</span>.  All of these values are 17, so the routine
goes through the <span class="code">for</span> loop without returning <span class="code">false</span>, and the
"<span class="code">return true</span>" statement after the end of the loop is executed.
For <span class="code">same(2)</span>, <span class="code">value.length</span> is 1, and the body of the
<span class="code">loop</span> is never executed; the return value is <span class="code">true</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;3:</p>
<p>What does it mean to sort an array?</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>To sort an array means to
rearrange the items in the array so that they are in increasing or decreasing
order (according to some criterion).</p>

<p>(Note: To be more accurate, we should say "non-decreasing" instead of
"increasing" and "non-increasing" instead of "decreasing."  An array can
contain duplicate values, and in that case, its elements can'be be put
into strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order.)</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;4:</p>
<p>What is the main advantage of binary search over linear search?  What is the
main disadvantage?</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>The advantage of binary search is that it is much faster.  On a list of
one million items, linear search would take an average of five hundred thousand steps to find an
item, whereas binary search would take only 20 steps.  The disadvantage is that
binary search only works on a sorted list, so some extra work must be done to
sort the list or to keep the list in sorted order as it is created.</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;5:</p>
<p>What is meant by a
<i>dynamic array?</i> What is the advantage of a dynamic array over a regular
array?</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>A dynamic array is like an array
in that it is a data structure that stores a sequence of items, all of the same
type, in numbered locations. It is different from an array in that there is no
preset upper limit on the number of items that it can contain. This is an
advantage in situations where a reasonable value for the size of the array is
not known at the time it is created.</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;6:</p>
<p>What does it mean to say that <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> is a
parameterized type?</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>A class name is a type, but as a parameterized type, 
<span class="classname">ArrayList</span> does not define just one type.
Instead, for every object type <span class="classname">T</span>, there is a type
<span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;T&gt;</span>.  <span class="classname">T</span>&nbsp;is a
"type parameter."  An object of type <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;T&gt;</span> is a list that can only hold objects of
type <span class="classname">T</span>.  We can have <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</span> to
represent lists of <span class="classname">Strings</span>, <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;</span>
to represent lists of <span class="classname">Integers</span>, and so one.  The fact that
<span class="classname">ArrayList</span> is a parameterized type means that we don't have
to create a new class for each type of list.</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;7:</p>
<p>Suppose that a variable <span class="code">strlst</span> has been declared as</p>

<pre>ArrayList&lt;String&gt; strlst = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();</pre>

<p>Assume that the list is not empty and that all the items in the list
are non-null. Write a code segment that will find and print the string in the list
that comes first in lexicographic order.</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>Strings can be compared for lexicographic order using the <span class="code">compareTo</span>
instance method in the <span class="classname">String</span> class.
We can find the smallest string as follows:</p>

<pre>String smallest = strlst.get(0);
for (int i = 1; i &lt; strlist.size(); i++) {
   String nextString = strlst.get(i);
   if ( nextString.compareTo(smallest) &lt; 0 ) 
       smallest = nextString;
}
System.out.println("The smallest string lexicographically is " + smallest);</pre>

<p>Alternatively, a for-each loop could be used:</p>

<pre>String smallest = strlst.get(0);
for (String item : strlst) {
   if ( item.compareTo(smallest) &lt; 0 ) 
       smallest = item;
}
System.out.println("The smallest string lexicographically is " + smallest)</pre>

<p>Not that in this version, the first item in the list is compared to itself
as the first step in the loop.  There is no easy way to leave that item out
of the for-each loop.</p>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;8:</p>
<p>Show the exact output
produced by the following code segment.</p>

<pre>char[][] pic = new char[6][6];
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++)
   for (int j = 0; j &lt; 6; j++) {
      if ( i == j  ||  i == 0  ||  i == 5 )
         pic[i][j] = '*';
      else
         pic[i][j] = '.';
   }
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++) {
   for (int j = 0; j &lt; 6; j++)
      System.out.print(pic[i][j]);
   System.out.println();
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>The output consists of six
lines, with each line containing six characters. In the first line, <span class="code">i</span>
is 0, so all the characters are *'s. In the last line, i is 5, so all the
characters are *'s. In each of the four lines in the middle, one of the
characters is a * and the rest are periods. The output is</p>

<pre>******
.*....
..*...
...*..
....*.
******</pre>

<p>It might help to look at the array items that are printed on each line. Note
that <span class="code">pic[row][col]</span> is '*' if <span class="code">row</span> is 0 or if <span class="code">row</span> is 5
or if <span class="code">row</span> and <span class="code">col</span> are equal.</p>

<pre>pic[0][0] pic[0][1] pic[0][2] pic[0][3] pic[0][4] pic[0][5] 
pic[1][0] pic[1][1] pic[1][2] pic[1][3] pic[1][4] pic[1][5] 
pic[2][0] pic[2][1] pic[2][2] pic[2][3] pic[2][4] pic[2][5] 
pic[3][0] pic[3][1] pic[3][2] pic[3][3] pic[3][4] pic[3][5] 
pic[4][0] pic[4][1] pic[4][2] pic[4][3] pic[4][4] pic[4][5] 
pic[5][0] pic[5][1] pic[5][2] pic[5][3] pic[5][4] pic[5][5]</pre>

</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;9:</p>
<p>Write a complete static method
that finds the largest value in an array of <span class="code">ints</span>. The method
should have one parameter, which is an array of type <span class="code">int[]</span>. The
largest number in the array should be returned as the value of the
method.</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>One possible answer is:</p>

<pre>public static int getMax(int[] list) {
   
   int max = list[0];  // This is the largest item seen so far.
   
   for (int i = 1; i &lt; list.length; i++) {
         // Look at each item in the array.  If the item is
         // bigger than max, then set max equal to the item.
       if (list[i] &gt; max)
          max = list[i];
   }
   
   // At this point, max is the largest item in the whole array.
   
   return max;
   
} // end getMax</pre>

<p>(Note that this method throws an exception if the
parameter <span class="code">list</span> is null or if it is an array of
length&nbsp;0.  The exception is thrown by the line
"<span class="code">int&nbsp;max&nbsp;=&nbsp;list[0];".  The reference
to <span class="code">list[0]</span> causes a <span class="classname">NullPointerException</span></span>
if <span class="code">list</span> is null and an <span class="classname">ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</span>
if the array has length zero.)</p>

<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;10:</p>
<p>Suppose that temperature
measurements were made on each day of 2018 in each of 100 cities. The
measurements have been stored in an array</p>

<pre>int[][]  temps  =  new  int[100][365];</pre>

<p>where <span class="code">temps[c][d]</span> holds the measurement for city number <span class="code">c</span>
on the <span class="code">d</span><sup>th</sup> day of the year. Write a code segment that will
print out the average temperature, over the course of the whole year, for each
city. The average temperature for a city can be obtained by adding up all 365
measurements for that city and dividing the answer by 365.0.</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>A pseudocode outline of the
answer is</p>

<pre>For each city {
   Add up all the temperatures for that city
   Divide the total by 365 and print the answer
}</pre>

<p>Adding up all the temperatures for a given city itself requires a for loop,
so the code segment looks like this:</p>

<pre>for (int city = 0; city &lt; 100; city++) {
    int total = 0;  // total of temperatures for this city
    for (int day = 0; day &lt; 365; day++)
       total = total + temps[city][day];
    double avg = total / 365.0;  // average temp for this city
    System.out.println("Average temp for city number " 
             + city + " is " + avg);
}</pre>

<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;11:</p>
<p>Suppose that a class,
<span class="classname">Employee,</span> is defined as follows:</p>

<pre>class Employee {
   String lastName;
   String firstName;
   double hourlyWage;
   int yearsWithCompany;
}</pre>

<p>Suppose that data about 100 employees is <b>already</b> stored in an
array:</p>

<pre>Employee[] employeeData = new Employee[100];</pre>

<p>Write a code segment that will output the first name, last name, and hourly
wage of each employee who has been with the company for 20 years or more.  Write two
versions of the code segment, one that uses a regular <span class="code">for</span> loop, and one that 
uses a for-each loop.</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-answer">
<p class="answer">Answer:</p>
<p>(The data for the i-th employee
is stored in an object that can be referred to as <span class="code">employeeData[i]</span>. The
four pieces of data about that employee are members of this object and can be
referred to as:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<span class="code">employeeData[i].firstName</span>
</li>

<li>
<span class="code">employeeData[i].lastName</span>
</li>

<li>
<span class="code">employeeData[i].hourlyWage</span>
</li>

<li>
<span class="code">employeeData[i].yearsWithCompany</span>
</li>

</ul>

<p>The code segment uses a for loop to consider each employee in the
array.)</p>

<pre>for (int i=0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
    if ( employeeData[i].yearsWithCompany &gt;= 20 )
        System.out.println(employeeData[i].firstName + " " +
                      employeeData[i].lastName + ": " +
                      employeeData[i].hourlyWage);
