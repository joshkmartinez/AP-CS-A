<h2 class="section_title">Array Processing</h2>
<hr class="break">
   
   

<p>
<span class="start"><big>M</big>ost examples of array processing</span> that we
have looked at have actually been fairly straightforward: processing
the elements of the array in order from beginning to end, or random
access to an arbitrary element of the array.  In this section
and later in the chapter, you'll see some of the more interesting
things that you can do with arrays.</p>
 

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="arrays.2.1">7.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Processing Examples</a>
</h3>   


<p>To begin, here's an example to remind you to be careful about
avoiding array indices outside the legal range.  Suppose that
<span class="code">lines</span> is an array of type <span class="code">String[]</span>,
and we want to know whether <span class="code">lines</span> contains any
duplicate elements in consecutive locations.  That is, we
want to know whether <span class="code">lines[i].equals(lines[i+1])</span>
for any index&nbsp;<span class="code">i</span>.  Here is a failed attempt
to check that condition:</p>


<pre>boolean dupp = false;  // Assume there are no duplicates
for ( int i = 0; i &lt; list.length; i++ ) {
    if ( lines[i].equals(lines[i+1]) ) {  // <span class="newcode">THERE IS AN ERROR HERE!</span>
        dupp = true;   // we have found a duplicate!
        break;
    }
}</pre>


<p>This <span class="code">for</span> loop looks like many others that we have written,
so what's the problem?  The error occurs when <span class="code">i</span> takes on
its final value in the loop, when <span class="code">i</span> is equal to <span class="code">lines.length-1</span>.
In that case, <span class="code">i+1</span> is equal to <span class="code">lines.length</span>.  But
the last element in the array has index <span class="code">lines.length-1</span>,
so <span class="code">lines.length</span> is not a legal index.  This means that the
reference to <span class="code">lines[i+1]</span> causes an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
This is easy to fix; we just need to stop the loop before <span class="code">i+1</span>
goes out of range:</p>


<pre>boolean dupp = false;  // Assume there are no duplicates
for ( int i = 0; i &lt; <span class="newcode">list.length - 1 </span>; i++ ) {
    if ( lines[i].equals(lines[i+1]) ) { 
        dupp = true;   // we have found a duplicate!
        break;
    }
}</pre>


<p>This type of error can be even more insidious when working with partially full
arrays (see <a href="../c3/s8.html#control.7a.4">Subsection&nbsp;3.8.4</a>), where usually only part of the array is in
use, and a counter is used to keep track of how many spaces in the array are used.
With a partially full array, the problem
is not looking beyond the end of the array, but looking beyond <i>the part of the array
that is in use</i>.  When your program tries to look beyond the end of an array, at
least the program will crash to let you know that there is a problem.  With a 
partially full array, the problem can go undetected.</p>


<hr class="break">



<p>For the next  example, let's continue with partially full arrays.  We have seen how to add
an item to a partially full array, but suppose that we also want to be able to
remove items?  Suppose that you write a game
program, and that players can join the game and leave the game as it
progresses. As a good object-oriented programmer, you probably have a class
named <span class="classname">Player</span> to represent the individual players in the game. A list
of all players who are currently in the game could be stored in an array,
<span class="code">playerList</span>, of type <span class="atype">Player[]</span>. Since the number of players can
change, you will follow the partially full array pattern, and
you will need a variable, <span class="code">playerCt</span>, to record the number
of players currently in the game. Assuming that there will never be more than
10 players in the game, you could declare the variables as:</p>


<pre>Player[] playerList = new Player[10];  // Up to 10 players.
int      playerCt = 0;  // At the start, there are no players.</pre>


<p>After some players have joined the game, <span class="code">playerCt</span> will be greater
than 0, and the player objects representing the players will be stored in the
array elements <span class="code">playerList[0]</span>, <span class="code">playerList[1]</span>, ...,
<span class="code">playerList[playerCt-1]</span>. Note that the array element
<span class="code">playerList[playerCt]</span> is <b>not</b> in use: Besides being the
number of items in the array, <span class="code">playerCt</span> is also the index
of the next open spot in the array. The procedure for
adding a new player, <span class="code">newPlayer</span>, to the game is simple:</p>


<pre>playerList[playerCt] = newPlayer; // Put new player in next
                                  //     available spot.
playerCt++;  // And increment playerCt to count the new player.</pre>


<p>But deleting a player from the game is a little harder, since you don't want to
leave a "hole" in the array where the deleted player used to be. 
Suppose you want to delete the player at index
<span class="code">k</span> in <span class="code">playerList</span>.  The number of players goes down
by one, so one fewer space is used in the array.  
If you are not worried about keeping the
players in any particular order, then one way to delete player number <span class="code">k</span> is to move the player
from the last occupied position in the array
into position <span class="code">k</span> and then
to decrement the value of <span class="code">playerCt</span>:</p>


<pre>playerList[k] = playerList[playerCt - 1];
playerCt--;</pre>


<p>The player previously in position <span class="code">k</span> is no longer in the array, so
we have deleted that player from the list.  The
player previously in position <span class="code">playerCt&nbsp;-&nbsp;1</span> is now in the array twice.
But it's only in the occupied or valid part of the array once, since
<span class="code">playerCt</span> has decreased by one. Remember that every element of the
array has to hold some value, but only the values in positions 0 through
<span class="code">playerCt&nbsp;-&nbsp;1</span> will be looked at or processed in any way.
(By the way, you should think about what happens if the player that is being deleted
is in the last position in the list.  The code does still work in this case.  What
exactly happens?)</p>


<p>Suppose that when deleting the player in position <span class="code">k</span>, you'd like to
keep the remaining players in the same order. (Maybe because they take turns in
the order in which they are stored in the array.) To do this, all the players
in positions <span class="code">k+1</span> and following must move up one position in the array.
Player <span class="code">k+1</span> replaces player <span class="code">k</span>, who is out of the game. Player
<span class="code">k+2</span> fills the spot left open when player <span class="code">k+1</span> is moved. And so
on. The code for this is</p>


<pre>for (int i = k+1; i &lt; playerCt; i++) {
    playerList[i-1] = playerList[i];
}
playerCt--;</pre>


<p>Here is an illustration of the two ways of deleting an item from a partially full
array.  Here, player "C" is being deleted:</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="delete-from-array.png" width="536" height="251" alt="how a partially full array changes when an item is deleted" class="bordered"></p>
    

<hr class="break">


<p>This leaves open the question of what happens when a partially full array
becomes full, but you still want to add more items to it?  We can't change
the size of the array&mdash;but we can make a new, bigger array and copy the data
from the old array into the new array.  But what does it mean to copy an
array in the first place?</p>


<p>Suppose that <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> are array variables, with the same base type,
and that <span class="code">A</span> already refers to an array.  Suppose that we want <span class="code">B</span> to
refer to a copy of <span class="code">A</span>.  The first thing to note is that
the assignment statement</p>


<pre>B = A;</pre>


<p>does <b>not</b> make a copy of <span class="code">A</span>.  Arrays are objects, and an array variable can only
hold a pointer to an array. The assignment statement copies the pointer from <span class="code">A</span>
into <span class="code">B</span>, and the result is that <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> now point
to the same array.  For example, <span class="code">A[0]</span> and <span class="code">B[0]</span> are just
different names for exactly the same array element.  To make <span class="code">B</span> refer to
a copy of <span class="code">A</span>, we need to make an entirely new array and copy all the items from
<span class="code">A</span> into <span class="code">B</span>.  Let's say that <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span>
are of type <span class="atype">double[]</span>.  Then to make a copy of <span class="code">A</span>, we can say</p>


<pre>double B;
B = new double[A.length];  // Make a new array with the same length as A.
for ( int i = 0; i &lt; A.length; i++ ) {
    B[i] = A[i];
}</pre>


<p>To solve the problem of adding to a partially full array that has become full,
we just need to make a new array that is bigger than the existing array.  The usual
choice is to make a new array twice as big as the old.  We need to meet one
more requirement:  At the end, the variable that referred to the old array
must now point to the new array.  That variable is what gives us access to the
data, and in the end, the data is in the new array.  Fortunately, a simple
assignment statement will make the variable point to the correct array.
Let's suppose that we are using <span class="code">playerList</span> and <span class="code">playerCt</span>
to store the players in a game, as in the example above, and we want to add
<span class="code">newPlayer</span> to the game.  Here is how we can do that even if the
<span class="code">playerList</span> array is full:</p>


<pre>if ( playerCt == playerList.length ) {
        // The number of players is already equal to the size of the array.
        // The array is full.  Make a new array that has more space.
    Player[] temp;   // A variable to point to the new array.
    temp = new Player[ 2*playerList.length ];  // Twice as big as the old array.
    for ( int i = 0; i &lt; playerList.length; i++ ) {
        temp[i] = playerList[i];  // Copy item from old array into new array.
    }
    playerList = temp;  // playerList now points to the new, bigger array.    
}
// At this point, we know that there is room in the array for newPlayer.
playerList[playerCt] = newPlayer;
playerCt++;
</pre>


<p>After the new array has been created, there is no longer any variable that
points to the old array, so it will be garbage collected.</p>

<a name="arrays.2.2">7.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Standard Array Methods</a>
</h3>


<p>Copying an array seems like such a common method that you might expect
Java to have a built-in method already defined to do it.  In fact,
Java comes with several standard array-processing methods.  The
methods are defined as <span class="code">static</span> methods in a class
named <span class="classname">Arrays</span>, which is in the package <span class="code">java.util</span>.
For example, for any array, <span class="code">list</span>,</p>
   

<pre>Arrays.copyOf( list, lengthOfCopy )</pre>


<p>is a function that returns a new array whose length is given by <span class="code">lengthOfCopy</span>,
containing items copied from <span class="code">list</span>.  If <span class="code">lengthOfCopy</span> is greater
than <span class="code">list.length</span>, then extra spaces in the new array will have their default
value (zero for numeric arrays, <span class="code">null</span> for object arrays, and so on).
If <span class="code">lengthOfCopy</span> is less than or equal to <span class="code">list.length</span>, then
only as many items are copied from <span class="code">list</span> as will fit in the new array.
So if <span class="code">A</span> is any array, then</p>


<pre>B = Arrays.copyOf( A, A.length );</pre>


<p>sets <span class="code">B</span> to refer to an exact copy of <span class="code">A</span>, and</p>


<pre>playerList = Arrays.copyOf( playerList, 2*playerList.length );</pre>


<p>could be used to double the amount of space available in a partially full array with
just one line of code.
We can also use <span class="code">Arrays.copyOf</span> to decrease the size of a partially full array.
We might want to do that to avoid having a lot of excess, unused spaces.  To implement
this idea, the code for deleting player number <span class="code">k</span> from the list of players
might become</p>


<pre>playerList[k] = playerList[playerCt-1];
playerCt--;
if ( playerCt &lt; playerList.length/4 ) {
        // More than 3/4 of the spaces are empty. Cut the array size in half.
    playerList = Arrays.copyOf( playerList, playerList.length/2 );
}</pre>


<p>I should mention that class <span class="classname">Arrays</span> actually contains a bunch
of <span class="code">copyOf</span> methods, one for each of the primitive types and one for
objects.  I should also note that when an array of objects is copied, it is only
pointers to objects that are copied into the new array.  The contents of the
objects are not copied.  This is the usual rule for assignment of pointers.</p>


<p>If what you want is a simple copy of an array,  with the same
size as the original, there is an even easier way to do it.  Every array has
an instance method named <span class="code">clone()</span> that makes a copy of the array.
To get a copy of an <span class="ptype">int</span> array, <span class="code">A</span>, for example,
you can simply say</p>


<pre>int[] B  =  A.clone();</pre>


<hr class="break">


<p>The <span class="classname">Arrays</span> class contains other useful methods.  I'll mention
a few of them.  As with <span class="code">Arrays.copyOf</span>, there are actually multiple versions
of all of these methods, for different array types.</p>


<ul>

<li>
<span class="codedef">Arrays.fill( array, value )</span> &mdash; Fill an entire array with
a specified value.  The type of <span class="code">value</span> must be compatible with  the base type of
the <span class="code">array</span>.  For example, assuming that <span class="code">numlist</span> is an array
of type <span class="atype">double[]</span>, then <span class="code">Arrays.fill(numlist,17)</span> will set
every element of <span class="code">numlist</span> to have the value 17.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">Arrays.fill( array, fromIndex, toIndex, value )</span> &mdash; Fills part
of the <span class="code">array</span> with <span class="code">value</span>, starting at index number <span class="code">fromIndex</span>
and ending with index number <span class="code">toIndex-1</span>.  Note that <span class="code">toIndex</span> itself 
is not included.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">Arrays.toString( array )</span> &mdash; A function that returns a <span class="classname">String</span>
containing all the values from <span class="code">array</span>, separated by commas and enclosed between
square brackets. The values in the array are converted into strings in the same way
they would be if they were printed out.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">Arrays.sort( array )</span> &mdash; Sorts the entire array.  To sort an 
array means to rearrange the values in the array so that they are in increasing order.
This method works for arrays of <span class="classname">String</span> and arrays of primitive type values
(except for <span class="ptype">boolean</span>, which would be kind of silly).  But it does not work
for all arrays, since it must be meaningful to compare any two values in the array, to
see which is "smaller."  We will discuss array-sorting algorithms in <a href="../c7/s4.html">Section&nbsp;7.4</a>.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">Arrays.sort( array, fromIndex, toIndex )</span> &mdash; Sorts just
the elements from <span class="code">array[fromIndex]</span> up to <span class="code">array[toIndex-1]</span>
</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">Arrays.binarySearch( array, value )</span> &mdash; Searches for <span class="code">value</span>
in the <span class="code">array</span>.  The array <b>must already be sorted</b> into increasing order.
This is a function that returns an <span class="ptype">int</span>.  If the value is found in the array,
the return value is the index of an element that contains that value.  If the value does not
occur in the array, the return value is&nbsp;-1.  We will discuss the binary search algorithm
in <a href="../c7/s4.html">Section&nbsp;7.4</a>.</li>

</ul>







<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="arrays.2.3">7.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;RandomStrings Revisited</a>
</h3>
   

<p>One of the examples in <a href="../c6/s2.html#GUI1.2.4">Subsection&nbsp;6.2.4</a> was a GUI program
that shows multiple copies of a message in random positions, colors, and fonts.
When the user clicks the program window, the positions, colors, and fonts are
changed to new random values.  But suppose that we want the message strings
to move.  That is, we want to run an animation where the strings drift
around in the window.  In that case, we need to store the properties of
each string, since they will be needed to redraw the strings in each frame
of the animation.  A new version of the program that does that is <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter7/RandomStringsWithArray.java">RandomStringsWithArray.java</a></span>.</p>


<p>There are 25 strings.  We need to store the (x,y) coordinates where each string is drawn,
the color of each string, and the font that is used for each string.  To make the
strings move, I also store a velocity for each string, represented as two numbers
<span class="code">dx</span> and <span class="code">dy</span>.  In each frame, the <span class="code">dx</span> for each string
is added to the <span class="code">x</span> coordinate of the string, and <span class="code">dy</span> is
added to the <span class="code">y</span> coordinate.  Now the data for the string could be
stored in six arrays</p>


<pre>double[] x = new double[25];  
double[] y = new double[25];
double[] dx = new double[25];  
double[] dy = new double[25];
Color[] color = new Color[25];
Font[] font = new Font[25];</pre>


<p>These arrays would be filled with random values. In the
<span class="code">draw()</span> method that draws the canvas, the <span class="code">i</span>-th string would be
drawn at the point <span class="code">(x[i],y[i])</span>. Its color would be given by
<span class="code">color[i]</span>. And it would be drawn in the font <span class="code">font[i]</span>.
(The <span class="code">dx</span> and <span class="code">dy</span> would not be used in <span class="code">draw()</span>;
they are used when updating the data for the next frame.)  This
would be accomplished by a <span class="code">draw()</span> method such as:</p>


<pre>public void draw() {
    GraphicsContext g = canvas.getGraphicsContext2D();
    g.setFill(Color.WHITE); // (Fill with white, erasing previous picture.)
    g.fillRect(0,0,canvas.getWidth(),canvas.getHeight());
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 25; i++) {
       g.setFill( color[i] );
       g.setFont( font[i] );
       g.fillText( MESSAGE, x[i], y[i] );
       g.setStroke(Color.BLACK);
       g.strokeText( MESSAGE, x[i], y[i] );
    }
}</pre>


<p>This approach is said to use <span class="newword">parallel arrays</span>.
The data for a given copy of the message is spread out across several arrays.
If you think of the arrays as laid out in parallel columns&mdash;array <span class="code">x</span>
in the first column, array <span class="code">y</span> in the second, array <span class="code">color</span> in
the third, and array <span class="code">font</span> in the fourth&mdash;then the data for the
<span class="code">i</span>-th string can be found along the <span class="code">i</span>-th row. There is
nothing wrong with using parallel arrays in this simple example, but it does go
against the object-oriented philosophy of keeping related data in one object.
If we follow this rule, then we don't have to <b>imagine</b> the relationship
among the data, because all the data for one copy of the message is physically
in one place. So, when I wrote the program, I made a simple class to represent
all the data that is needed for one copy of the message:</p>


<pre>private static class StringData {  // Info needed to draw one string.
    double x,y;       // location of the string;
    double dx,dy;     // velocity of the string;
    Color color;      // color of the string;
    Font font;        // the font that is used to draw the string
}</pre>


<p>To store the data for multiple copies of the message, I use an array of
type <span class="atype">StringData[]</span>. The array is declared as an instance variable, with
the name <span class="code">stringData</span>:</p>


<pre>StringData[] stringData;</pre>


<p>Of course, the value of <span class="code">stringData</span> is <span class="code">null</span> until an actual array
is created and assigned to it. The array has to be created and filled with data.
Furthermore, each element of the array is an object of type <span class="classname">StringData</span>
which has to be created before it can be used.  The following subroutine 
creates the array and fills it with random data:</p>


<pre>private void createStringData() {
    stringData = new StringData[25];
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 25; i++) {
        stringData[i] = new StringData();
        stringData[i].x = canvas.getWidth() * Math.random();
        stringData[i].y = canvas.getHeight() * Math.random();
        stringData[i].dx = 1 + 3*Math.random();
        if (Math.random() &lt; 0.5) // 50% chance that dx is negative
            stringData[i].dx = -stringData[i].dx;
        stringData[i].dy = 1 + 3*Math.random();
        if (Math.random() &lt; 0.5) // 50% chance that dy is negative
            stringData[i].dy = -stringData[i].dy;
        stringData[i].color = Color.hsb( 360*Math.random(), 1.0, 1.0 );
        stringData[i].font = fonts[ (int)(5*Math.random()) ];
    }
}</pre>



<p>This method is called in the <span class="code">start()</span> method.  It is also called to
make new random data when the user clicks a button.  The strings can
now be drawn using a for loop such as:</p>


<pre>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 25; i++) {
    g.setFill( <span class="newcode">stringData[i].</span>color );
    g.setFont( <span class="newcode">stringData[i].</span>font );
    g.fillText( MESSAGE, <span class="newcode">stringData[i].</span>x, <span class="newword">stringData[i].</span>y );
    g.setStroke(Color.BLACK);
    g.strokeText( MESSAGE, <span class="newcode">stringData[i].</span>x, <span class="newword">stringData[i].</span>y );
}</pre>
   

<p>But in fact, in my program, I used an equivalent for-each loop, which might be easier
to understand:</p>
   

<pre>for ( StringData data : stringData ) {
    g.setFill( data.color );
    g.setFont( data.font);
    g.fillText( MESSAGE, data.x, data.y );
    g.setStroke( Color.BLACK );
    g.strokeText( MESSAGE, data.x, data.y );
}</pre>
   

<p>In this loop, the loop control variable, <span class="code">data</span>, holds a copy of one
of the values from the array.  That value is a reference to an object of type
<span class="classname">StringData</span>, which has instance variables named
<span class="code">color</span>, <span class="code">font</span>, <span class="code">x</span>, and <span class="code">y</span>.
Once again, the use of a for-each loop has eliminated the need to work with
array indices.</p>


<p>As for how the animation is done, you can check out the full
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter7/RandomStringsWithArray.java">source code</a></span>.  Animation was
discussed in <a href="../c6/s3.html#GUI1.3.5">Subsection&nbsp;6.3.5</a>.</p>



<hr class="break">


<p>
<span class="code">RandomStringsWithArray</span> uses one other array of objects. The font for a given copy of the
message is chosen at random from a set of five possible fonts. In the original
version, there were five variables of type <span class="classname">Font</span> to
represent the fonts. The variables were named <span class="code">font1</span>, <span class="code">font2</span>,
<span class="code">font3</span>, <span class="code">font4</span>, and <span class="code">font5</span>. To select one of these
fonts at random, a <span class="code">switch</span> statement can be used:</p>


<pre>Font randomFont;  // One of the 5 fonts, chosen at random.
int rand;         // A random integer in the range 0 to 4.

fontNum = (int)(Math.random() * 5);
switch (fontNum) {
   case 0:
      randomFont = font1;
      break;
   case 1:
      randomFont = font2;
      break;
   case 2:
      randomFont = font3;
      break;
   case 3:
      randomFont = font4;
      break;
   case 4:
      randomFont = font5;
      break;
}</pre>


<p>In the new version of the program, the five fonts are stored in an array,
which is named <span class="code">fonts</span>. This array is declared as an instance
variable of type <span class="atype">Font[]</span>
</p>


<pre>Font[] fonts;</pre>


<p>The array is created in the constructor, using the array literal
syntax from <a href="../c7/s1.html#arrays.1.3">Subsection&nbsp;7.1.3</a>:</p>


<pre>fonts= new Font[] {
        Font.font("Times New Roman", FontWeight.BOLD, 20),
        Font.font("Arial", FontWeight.BOLD, FontPosture .ITALIC, 28),
        Font.font("Verdana", 32),
        Font.font(40),
        Font.font("Times New Roman", FontWeight.BOLD, FontPosture .ITALIC, 60)
};</pre>


<p>This makes it much easier to select one of the fonts at random. It can be
done with the statements</p>


<pre>Font randomFont;  // One of the 5 fonts, chosen at random.
int fontIndex;    // A random number in the range 0 to 4.
fontIndex = (int)(Math.random() * 5);
randomFont = fonts[ fontIndex ];</pre>


<p>The <span class="code">switch</span> statement has been replaced by a few lines of code.
In fact, the preceding four lines can be replaced by the single line</p>
   

<pre>Font randomFont = fonts[ (int)(Math.random() * 5) ];</pre>
   

<p>This is a very typical application of arrays. Note that this example uses
the random access property:  We can pick an array index at random
and go directly to the array element at that index.</p>


<p>Here is another example of the
same sort of thing. Months are often stored as numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., 12.
Sometimes, however, these numbers have to be translated into the names January,
February, ..., December. The translation can be done very easily with an array. The array
can be declared and initialized as</p>


<pre>static String[] monthName = { "January", "February", "March",
                              "April",   "May",      "June",
                              "July",    "August",   "September",
                              "October", "November", "December" };</pre>


<p>If <span class="code">mnth</span> is a variable that holds one of the integers 1 through 12,
then <span class="code">monthName[mnth-1]</span> is the name of the corresponding month. We need
the "<span class="code">-1</span>" because months are numbered starting from 1, while array
elements are numbered starting from 0. Simple array indexing does the
translation for us!</p>

<a name="arrays.2.4">7.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Dynamic Arrays</a>
</h3>
   

<p>Earlier, we discussed how a partially full array can be used to store a list of
players in a game, allowing the list to grow and shrink over the course of the game.
The list is "dynamic" in the sense that its size changes while the program is running.
Dynamic lists are very common, and we might think about trying to write a class to
represent the concept.  By writing a class, we can avoid having to repeat the same
code every time we want to use a similar data structure.
We want something that is like an array, except that its
size can change.  Think about operations that we might want to perform
on a dynamic array.  Some essential and useful operations would include</p>


<ul>

<li>add an item to the end of the array</li>

<li>remove the item at a specified position in the array</li>

<li>get the value of one of the elements in the array</li>

<li>set the value of one of the elements in the array</li>

<li>get the number of items currently in the array</li>

</ul>


<p>When we design our class, these operations will become instance methods in that
class.  The items in the dynamic array will actually be stored in a normal array,
using the partially full array pattern.  Using what we know, the class is not
difficult to write.  We do have to decide what to do when an attempt is made to access an
array element that doesn't exist.  It seems natural to throw an
index-out-of-bounds exception in that case.
Let's suppose that the items in the array will be of type
<span class="ptype">int</span>.</p>


<pre>import java.util.Arrays;

/**
 * Represents a list of int values that can grow and shrink.
 */
public class DynamicArrayOfInt {
    
    private int[] items = new int[8];  // partially full array holding the ints
    private int itemCt;
    
    /**
     * Return the item at a given index in the array.  
     * Throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if the index is not valid.
     */
    public int get( int index ) {
        if ( index &lt; 0 || index &gt;= itemCt )
            throw new ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException("Illegal index, " + index);
        return items[index];
    }
    
    /**
     * Set the value of the array element at a given index. 
     * Throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if the index is not valid.
     */
    public void set( int index, int item ) {
        if ( index &lt; 0 || index &gt;= itemCt )
            throw new ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException("Illegal index, " + index);
        items[index] = item;
    }
    
    /**
     * Returns the number of items currently in the array.
     */
    public int size() {
        return itemCt;
    }
    
    /**
     * Adds a new item to the end of the array.  The size increases by one.
     */
    public void add(int item) {
        if (itemCt == items.length)
            items = Arrays.copyOf( items, 2*items.length );
        items[itemCt] = item;
        itemCt++;
    }
    
    /**
     * Removes the item at a given index in the array.  The size of the array
     * decreases by one.  Items following the removed item are moved up one
     * space in the array.
     * Throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if the index is not valid.
     */
    public void remove(int index) {
        if ( index &lt; 0 || index &gt;= itemCt )
            throw new ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException("Illegal index, " + index);
        for (int j = index+1; j &lt; itemCt; j++)
            items[j-1] = items[j];
        itemCt--;
    }
    
} // end class DynamicArrayOfInt</pre>


<p>Everything here should be clear, except possibly why the original size of the
<span class="code">items</span> array is&nbsp;8.  In fact, the number 8 is arbitrary and has no
effect on the functionality of the class.  Any positive integer would work, but it
doesn't make sense for the array to start off very big.  The array will grow
as needed if the number of items turns out to be large.</p>


<p>The example <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter3/ReverseInputNumbers.java">ReverseInputNumbers.java</a></span> used a partially full array
of <span class="ptype">int</span> to print a list of input numbers in the reverse of the order in
which they are input.  In that program, an ordinary array of length 100 was used to 
hold the numbers.  In any given run of the program, the size of the array could
be much too large, or it could be too small, resulting in an exception.  The program
can now be written using a DynamicArrayOfInt, which will adapt itself to any reasonable number
of inputs.  For the program, see <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter7/ReverseWithDynamicArray.java">ReverseWithDynamicArray.java</a></span>.
It's a silly program, but the principle holds in any application where the amount of
data cannot be predicted in advance: The size of a dynamic data structure can
adapt itself to any amount of data, limited only by the amount of memory available
to the program.</p>


<p>This is a nice example, but there is a real problem with it.  Suppose that
we want to have a dynamic array of <span class="classname">String</span>.  We can't use
a <span class="classname">DynamicArrayOfInt</span> object to hold strings, so it looks
like we need to write a whole new class, <span class="classname">DynamicArrayOfString</span>.
If we want a dynamic array to store players in a game, we would need a class
<span class="classname">DynamicArrayOfPlayer</span>.  And so on.  It looks like we have
to write a dynamic array class for every possible type of data!  That can't be
right!  In fact, Java has a solution to this problem, a standard class that
implements dynamic arrays and can work with any type of data.  The class
is called <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>, and we'll see how it works
in the <a href="../c7/s3.html">next&nbsp;section</a>.</p>
