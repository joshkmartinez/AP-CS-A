<span class="start"><big>C</big>omputers get a lot of their power</span> from working
with <span class="newword">data structures</span>. A data structure is an
organized collection of related data. An object is a data structure, but this
type of data structure&mdash;consisting of a fairly small number of named instance
variables&mdash;is just the beginning. In many cases, programmers build
complicated data structures by hand, by linking objects together. We'll look at
these custom-built data structures in <a href="../c9/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;9</a>. But there is one type of
data structure that is so important and so basic that it is built into every
programming language: the array.</p>


<p>You have already encountered arrays in <a href="../c3/s8.html">Section&nbsp;3.8</a>
and <a href="../c5/s1.html#OOP.1.4">Subsection&nbsp;5.1.4</a>.  We continue the study of arrays in this chapter,
including some new details of their use and some additional array-processing
techniques.  In particular, we will look at the important topic of algorithms for
searching and sorting an array.</p>


<p>An array has a fixed size that can't be changed after the array is created.
But in many cases, it is useful to have a data structure that can grow and shrink
as necessary.  In this chapter, we will look at a standard class, 
<span class="classname">ArrayList</span>, that represents such a data structure.</p>
