<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;1:</p>

<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;2:</p>
<p>What is the purpose of the following variable-arity method? What are
the values of <span class="code">same(1,2,3)</span>, <span class="code">same(17,17,17,17)</span>,
and <span class="code">same(2)</span>?  Why?</p>

<p>Suppose that a variable <span class="code">strlst</span> has been declared as</p>

<pre>ArrayList&lt;String&gt; strlst = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();</pre>

<p>Assume that the list is not empty and that all the items in the list
are non-null. Write a code segment that will find and print the string in the list
that comes first in lexicographic order.</p>

<p>Show the exact output
produced by the following code segment.</p>

<p class="question">Question&nbsp;9:</p>
<p>Write a complete static method
that finds the largest value in an array of <span class="code">ints</span>. The method
should have one parameter, which is an array of type <span class="code">int[]</span>. The
largest number in the array should be returned as the value of the
method.</p>

<p class="question">Question&nbsp;10:</p>
<p>Suppose that temperature
measurements were made on each day of 2018 in each of 100 cities. The
measurements have been stored in an array</p>

<pre>int[][]  temps  =  new  int[100][365];</pre>

<p>where <span class="code">temps[c][d]</span> holds the measurement for city number <span class="code">c</span>
on the <span class="code">d</span><sup>th</sup> day of the year. Write a code segment that will
print out the average temperature, over the course of the whole year, for each
city. The average temperature for a city can be obtained by adding up all 365
measurements for that city and dividing the answer by 365.0.</p>
</div>
<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;11:</p>
<p>Suppose that a class,
<span class="classname">Employee,</span> is defined as follows:</p>

   String lastName;
   String firstName;
   double hourlyWage;
   int yearsWithCompany;
}</pre>

<p>Suppose that data about 100 employees is <b>already</b> stored in an
array:</p>

<pre>Employee[] employeeData = new Employee[100];</pre>

<p>Write a code segment that will output the first name, last name, and hourly
wage of each employee who has been with the company for 20 years or more.  Write two
versions of the code segment, one that uses a regular <span class="code">for</span> loop, and one that 
uses a for-each loop.</p>

<div class="quiz-question">
<p class="question">Question&nbsp;12:</p>
<p>What is the purpose of the
