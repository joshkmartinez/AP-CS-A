<hr class="break">
   
   

<p>
<span class="start"><big>A</big>rray basics have been discussed</span> in previous chapters,
but there are still details of Java syntax to be filled in, and there is a lot more to say
about using arrays.  This section looks at some of the syntactic details, 
with more information about array processing to come in the rest of the
chapter.</p>
   

<p>To briefly review some of the basics....  An array is a numbered sequence
of <i>elements</i>, and each element acts like a separate variable.  All of the
elements are of the same type, which is called the <i>base type</i> of the array.
The array as a whole also has a type.  If the base type is <span class="classname">btype</span>,
then the array is of type <span class="atype">btype[]</span>.  Each element in the array
has an <i>index</i>, which is just its numerical position in the sequence of elements.
If the array is <span class="code">A</span>, then the i-th element of the array is <span class="code">A[i]</span>.
The number of elements in an array is called its <i>length</i>.  The length of
an array <span class="code">A</span> is <span class="code">A.length</span>.  The length of an array can't
be changed after the array is created.  The elements of the array <span class="code">A</span>
are <span class="code">A[0]</span>, <span class="code">A[1]</span>, ..., <span class="code">A[A.length-1]</span>.
An attempt to refer to an array element with an index outside the range
from zero to <span class="code">A.length-1</span> causes an <span class="classname">ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</span>.
</p>


<p>Arrays in Java are objects, so an array variable can only <b>refer</b> to an array;
it does <b>not</b> contain the array.  The value of an array variable can also be <span class="code">null</span>.
In that case, it does not refer to any array, and an attempt to refer to an
array element such as <span class="code">A[i]</span> will cause a <span class="classname">NullPointerException</span>.
Arrays are created using a special form of the <span class="code">new</span> operator. For
example,</p>


<pre>int[] A = new int[10];</pre>


<p>creates a new array with base type <span class="ptype">int</span> and length 10, and it sets
the variable <span class="code">A</span> to refer to the newly created array.</p>




<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="arrays.1.1">7.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;For-each Loops</a>
</h3>   


<p>Arrays are often processed using <span class="code">for</span> loops.  A <span class="code">for</span>
loop makes it easy to process each element in an array from beginning to end.  For
example, if <span class="code">namelist</span> is an array of <span class="classname">Strings</span>, 
then all the values in the list can be printed using</p>


<pre>for (int i = 0; i &lt; namelist.length; i++) {
    System.out.println( namelist[i] );
}</pre>


<p>This type of processing is so common that there is an alternative form of
the <span class="code">for</span> loop that makes it easier to write.  The alternative
is called a <span class="newword">for-each loop</span>.   It is probably easiest to
start with an example.  Here is a for-each loop for printing all the values
in an array of <span class="classname">Strings</span>:</p>


<pre>for ( String name : namelist ) {
    System.out.println( name );
}</pre>


<p>The meaning of "<span class="code">for (String name : namelist)</span>" is
"for each String, name, in the array, namelist, do the following".  The effect
is that the variable <span class="code">name</span> takes on each of the values in <span class="code">namelist</span>
in turn, and the body of the loop is executed for each of those values.  Note that
there is no array index in the loop.  The loop control variable, <span class="code">name</span>,
represents one of the values in the array, not the index of one of the values.
</p>


<p>The for-each loop is meant specifically for processing all the values
in a data structure, and we will see in <a href="../c10/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;10</a> that it applies to other
data structures besides arrays.  The for-each loop makes it possible to process the
values without even knowing the details of how the data is structured.  In the
case of arrays, it lets you avoid the complications of using array indices.</p>


<p>A for-each loop
will perform the same operation for each value that is stored
in an array.  
If <span class="code">itemArray</span> is an array of type <span class="atype">BaseType[]</span>,
then a for-each loop for <span class="code">itemArray</span> has the form:</p>
   

<pre>for ( BaseType item : itemArray ) {
   .
   .  // process the item
   .
}</pre>
   

<p>As usual, the braces are optional if there is only one statement inside the loop.
In this loop, <span class="code">item</span> is the loop control variable.  It is
declared as a variable of type <span class="classname">BaseType</span>, where
<span class="classname">BaseType</span> is the base type of the array.  (In a
for-each loop, the loop control variable <b>must</b> be declared in the
loop; it cannot be a variable that already exists outside the loop.)  
When this loop is executed, each value from the array is assigned
to <span class="code">item</span> in turn and the body of the loop is executed for each
value.  Thus, the above loop is exactly equivalent to:</p>
   

<pre>for ( int index = 0; index &lt; itemArray.length; index++ ) {
   BaseType item;
   item = itemArray[index];  // Get one of the values from the array
     .
     .  // process the item
     .  
}</pre>
   

<p>For example, if <span class="code">A</span> is an array of type <span class="atype">int[]</span>, then
we could print all the values from <span class="code">A</span> with the for-each loop:</p>
   

<pre>for ( int item : A )
   System.out.println( item );</pre>


<p>and we could add up all the positive integers in <span class="code">A</span> with:</p>
   

<pre>int sum = 0;   // This will be the sum of all the positive numbers in A.
for ( int item : A ) {
   if (item &gt; 0)
      sum = sum + item;
}</pre>
   

<p>The for-each loop is not always appropriate.  For example, there is no
simple way to use it to process the items in just a part of an array, or to
process the elements in reverse order.
However, it does make the code a little simpler when you do want to process all the values, in order.
since it eliminates any need to use array indices.</p>   
   

<p>It's important to note that a for-each loop processes the <b>values</b> in
the array, not the <b>elements</b> (where an element means the actual memory
location that is part of the array).  For example, consider the following
incorrect attempt to fill an array of integers with 17's:</p>
   

<pre>int[] intList = new int[10];
for ( int item : intList ) {   <span class="newcode">// INCORRECT! DOES NOT MODIFY THE ARRAY!</span>
   item = 17;
}</pre>
   

<p>The assignment statement <span class="code">item = 17</span> assigns the value 17 to
the loop control variable, <span class="code">item</span>.  However, this has nothing to
do with the array.  When the body of the loop is executed, the
value from one of the elements of the array is copied into <span class="code">item</span>.
The statement <span class="code">item&nbsp;=&nbsp;17</span> replaces that copied value
but has no effect on the array element from which it was copied; the
value in the array is not changed.  The loop is equivalent to</p>
  

<pre>int[] intList = new int[10];
for ( int i = 0; i &lt; intList.length; i++ ) {
   int item = intList[i];
   item = 17;
}</pre>
   

<p>which certainly does not change the value of any element in the array.</p>

<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="arrays.1.2">7.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Variable Arity Methods</a>
</h3>


<p>Before Java 5, every method in Java had a fixed arity.
(The <span class="newword">arity</span> of a method is defined as the number
of parameters in a call to the method.)  In a fixed arity method, the number
of parameters must be the same in every call to the method and must be the same
as the number of formal parameters in the method's definition.  Java&nbsp;5 introduced
<span class="newword">variable arity methods</span>.  In a variable arity method, different
calls to the method can have different numbers of parameters.  For example,
the formatted output method <span class="code">System.out.printf</span>, which was introduced
in <a href="../c2/s4.html#basics.4.1">Subsection&nbsp;2.4.1</a>, is a variable arity method.  The first
parameter of <span class="code">System.out.printf</span> must be a <span class="classname">String</span>,
but it can have any number of additional parameters, of any types.</p>


<p>Calling a variable arity method is no different from calling any other
sort of method, but writing one requires some new syntax.  As an example,
consider a method that can compute the average of any number of values of
type <span class="ptype">double</span>.  The definition of such a method could begin
with:</p>
   

<pre>public static double average( double...  numbers ) {</pre>
   

<p>Here, the <span class="code">...</span> after the type name, <span class="code">double</span>, 
is what makes this a variable arity method.  It indicates
that any number of values of type <span class="ptype">double</span> can be provided when
the subroutine is called, so that for example <span class="code">average(1,4,9,16)</span>, 
<span class="code">average(3.14,2.17)</span>, <span class="code">average(0.375)</span>, and even
<span class="code">average()</span> are all legal calls to this method.  Note that 
actual parameters of type <span class="ptype">int</span> can be passed to <span class="code">average</span>.
The integers will, as usual, be automatically converted to real numbers.</p>


<p>When the method is called, the values of all the actual parameters
that correspond to the variable arity parameter are placed into an array,
and it is this array that is actually passed to the method.  That is,
in the body of a method, a variable arity parameter of type
<span class="classname">T</span> actually looks like an ordinary parameter of type
<span class="atype">T[]</span>.  The length of the array tells you how many actual parameters
were provided in the method call.  In the <span class="code">average</span> example, the body
of the method would see an array named <span class="code">numbers</span> of type <span class="atype">double[]</span>.
The number of actual parameters in the method call would be <span class="code">numbers.length</span>,
and the values of the actual parameters would be <span class="code">numbers[0]</span>,
<span class="code">numbers[1]</span>, and so on.  A complete definition of the method would be:
</p>
   

<pre>public static double average( double... numbers ) {
        // Inside this method, numbers is of type double[].
   double sum;      // The sum of all the actual parameters.
   double average;  // The average of all the actual parameters.
   sum = 0;
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; numbers.length; i++) {
      sum = sum + numbers[i];  // Add one of the actual parameters to the sum.
   }
   average = sum / numbers.length;
   return average;
}</pre>



<p>By the way, it is possible to pass a single array
to a variable arity method, instead of a list of individual values.  For example, suppose that
<span class="code">salesData</span> is a variable of type <span class="atype">double[]</span>. Then
it would be legal to call <span class="code">average(salesData)</span>, and this would compute
the average of all the numbers in the array.</p>


<p>The formal parameter list in the definition of a variable-arity method can 
include more than one parameter, but the <span class="code">...</span> can only be applied to the
very last formal parameter.</p>
   

<p>As an example, consider a method that can draw a polygon through
any number of points.  The points are given as values of type <span class="classname">Point</span>,
where an object of type <span class="classname">Point</span> has two instance variables,
<span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span>, of type <span class="ptype">double</span>.
In this case, the method has one ordinary parameter&mdash;the
graphics context that will be used to draw the polygon&mdash;in addition to the
variable arity parameter.  Remember that inside the definition of the
method, the parameter <span class="code">points</span> becomes an array of 
<span class="classname">Points</span>:</p>
   

<pre>public static void drawPolygon(GraphicsContext g, Point... points) {
    if (points.length &gt; 1) {  // (Need at least 2 points to draw anything.)
       for (int i = 0; i &lt; points.length - 1; i++) {
           // Draw a line from i-th point to (i+1)-th point
           g.strokeLine( points[i].x, points[i].y, points[i+1].x, points[i+1].y );
       }
       // Now, draw a line back to the starting point.
       g.strokeLine( points[points.length-1].x, points[points.length-1].y,
                       points[0].x, points[0].y );
    }
}</pre>


<p>When this method is called, the subroutine call statement must have one actual parameter
of type <span class="classname">GraphicsContext</span>, which can be followed by any number of
actual parameters of type <span class="classname">Point</span>.</p>
   

<p>For a final example, let's look at a method that strings together all of the
values in a list of strings into a single, long string.  This example uses a for-each
loop to process the array:</p>


<pre>public static String concat( String... values ) {
   StringBuilder buffer;  // Use a StringBuilder for more efficient concatenation.
   buffer = new StringBuilder();  // Start with an empty StringBuilder.
   for ( String str : values ) { // A "for each" loop for processing the values.
       buffer.append(str); // Add string to the buffer.
   }
   return buffer.toString(); // return the contents of the buffer
}</pre>


<p>Given this method definition, the method call <span class="code">concat("Hello", "World")</span>
would return the string "HelloWorld", and <span class="code">concat()</span> would
return an empty string. Since a variable arity method can also accept an
array as actual parameter, we could also call <span class="code">concat(lines)</span>
where <span class="code">lines</span> is of type <span class="atype">String[]</span>.  This would 
concatenate all the elements of the array into a single string.</p>


   

<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="arrays.1.3">7.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Array Literals</a>
</h3>
  

<p>We have seen that it is possible to initialize an array variable 
with a list of values at the time it is declared.
For example,</p>


<pre>int[] squares = { 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49 };</pre>


<p>This initializes <span class="code">squares</span> to refer to a newly created array
that contains the seven values in the list.</p>



<p>A list initializer of this form can be used <b>only</b> in a declaration
statement, where it gives an initial value to a newly declared array variable. It
cannot be used in an assignment statement to assign a value to a variable that
already existed. However, there is another, similar notation for
creating a new array that can be used in other places. The notation uses 
another form of the <span class="code">new</span>
operator to both create a new array object and fill it with values.
(The rather odd syntax
is similar to the syntax for anonymous inner classes, which were discussed in
<a href="../c5/s8.html#OOP.8.3">Subsection&nbsp;5.8.3</a>.) As an example, to assign a new value to
an array variable, <span class="code">cubes</span>, of type <span class="atype">int[]</span>, you could
use:</p>


<pre>cubes = new int[] { 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343 };</pre>


<p>This is an assignment statement rather than a declaration, so the
array initializer syntax, without "<span class="code">new int[]</span>," would not
be legal here.  The general syntax for this form of the 
<span class="code">new</span> operator is</p>


<pre>new <span class="bnf">base-type</span> [ ] { <span class="bnf">list-of-values</span> }</pre>


<p>This is actually an expression whose value is a reference to a newly created
array object.  In this sense, it is an "array literal," since it is something that you can type
in a program to represent a value. This means that it can be used in any
context where an object of type <span class="bnf">base-type</span><span class="code">[]</span> is legal.
For example, you could pass the newly created array as an actual parameter to
a subroutine.  Consider the following utility method for creating a menu
from an array of strings.  (Menus were discussed in <a href="../c6/s6.html#GUI1.6.2">Subsection&nbsp;6.6.2</a>.)</p>


<pre>/**
 * Creates a Menu.  The names for the MenuItems in the menu are
 *     given as an array of Strings.
 * @param menuName  the name for the Menu that is to be created.
 * @param itemNames  an array holding the text that appears in each
 *     MenuItem.  If a null value appears in the array, the corresponding
 *     item in the menu will be a separator rather than a MenuItem.
 * @return  the menu that has been created and filled with items.
 */
public static Menu createMenu( String menuName, String[] itemNames ) {
    Menu menu = new Menu(menuName);
    for ( String itemName : itemNames ) {
        if ( itemName == null ) {
            menu.getItems().add( new SeparatorMenuItem() );
        }
        else {
            MenuItem item = new MenuItem(itemName);
            menu.getItems().add(item);
        }
    }
    return menu;
}
</pre>


<p>The second parameter in a call to <span class="code">createMenu</span> is an array of 
strings.  The array that is passed as an actual parameter could be created
in place, using the <span class="code">new</span> operator.  For example, 
we can use the following statement to create an entire File menu:</p>


<pre>Menu fileMenu = createMenu( "File", 
              <span class="newcode">new String[] { "New", "Open", "Close", null, "Quit" }</span> );</pre>
   

<p>This should convince you that
being able to create and use an array "in place" in this way can be very convenient,
in the same way that anonymous inner classes are convenient.  (However, this
example could have been done even more conveniently if <span class="code">createMenu()</span>
had been written as a variable arity method!)</p>
   

<p>By the way, it is perfectly legal to use the "<span class="code">new BaseType[] {&nbsp;...&nbsp;}</span>" syntax
instead of the array initializer syntax in the declaration of an array variable.  For example,
instead of saying:</p>
   

<pre>int[] primes = { 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 };</pre>
   

<p>you can say, equivalently,</p>
   

<pre>int[] primes = new int[] { 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 17, 19 };</pre>
   

<p>In fact, rather than use a special notation that works only in the context
of declaration statements, I sometimes prefer to use the second form.</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>One final note: For historical reasons, an array declaration such as</p>


<pre>int[] list;</pre>


<p>can also be written as</p>
   

<pre>int list[];</pre>


<p>which is a syntax used in the languages C and C++. However, this alternative
syntax does not really make much sense in the context of Java, and it is
probably best avoided. After all, the intent is to declare a variable of a
certain type, and the name of that type is "<span class="atype">int[]</span>". It makes sense to
follow the "<span class="bnf">type-name</span>  <span class="bnf">variable-name</span>;" syntax for such declarations.</p>
