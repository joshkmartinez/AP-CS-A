<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 7.6:</h3>
<p>Write a program that will read a text file selected by the user,
and will make an alphabetical list of all the different words in that file.  All words
should be converted to lower case, and duplicates should be eliminated from the list.
The list should be written to an output file selected by the user.  As discussed
in <a href="../c2/s4.html#basics.4.4">Subsection&nbsp;2.4.4</a>, you can use <span class="classname">TextIO</span> to read and
write files.  Use a variable of type <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</span> to
store the words.  It is not easy to separate a file into words as you are reading
it, especially if you want to allow apostrophes in the middle of a word.  
You can use the following method in your program:</p>

<pre>/**
 * Read the next word from TextIO, if there is one.  First, skip past
 * any non-letters in the input.  If an end-of-file is encountered before 
 * a word is found, return null.  Otherwise, read and return the word.
 * A word is defined as a sequence of letters.  Also, a word can include
 * an apostrophe if the apostrophe is surrounded by letters on each side.
 * @return the next word from TextIO, or null if an end-of-file is 
 *     encountered
 */
private static String readNextWord() {
   char ch = TextIO.peek(); // Look at next character in input.
   while (ch != TextIO.EOF &amp;&amp; ! Character.isLetter(ch)) {
          // Skip past non-letters.
      TextIO.getAnyChar();  // Read the character.
      ch = TextIO.peek();   // Look at the next character.
   }
   if (ch == TextIO.EOF) // Encountered end-of-file
      return null;
   // At this point, we know the next character is a letter, so read a word.
   String word = "";  // This will be the word that is read.
   while (true) {
      word += TextIO.getAnyChar();  // Append the letter onto word.
      ch = TextIO.peek();  // Look at next character.
      if ( ch == '\'' ) {
            // The next character is an apostrophe.  Read it, and
            // if the following character is a letter, add both the
            // apostrophe and the letter onto the word and continue
            // reading the word.  If the character after the apostrophe
            // is not a letter, the word is done, so break out of the loop.
         TextIO.getAnyChar();   // Read the apostrophe.
         ch = TextIO.peek();    // Look at char that follows apostrophe.
         if (Character.isLetter(ch)) {
            word += "\'" + TextIO.getAnyChar();
            ch = TextIO.peek();  // Look at next char.
         }
         else
            break;
      }
      if ( ! Character.isLetter(ch) ) {
            // If the next character is not a letter, the word is
            // finished, so break out of the loop.
         break;
      }
      // If we haven't broken out of the loop, next char is a letter.
   }
   return word;  // Return the word that has been read.
}</pre>

<p>Note that this method will return <span class="code">null</span> when the file has been
entirely read.  You can use this as a signal to stop processing the input file.</p>

<p>This is actually not a very difficult program to write.
The main point of the exercise is to get you to use a list of strings and
to do something with files.</p>

<p>There are several possible approaches to this problem.  One approach is to simply dump
all the words from the file into a list, without worrying about eliminating
duplicates or keeping the list in order.  After the file has been read, the list
can be sorted and printed.  Although the list can contain duplicates, the output
file should list each word only once.  However, it's easy to leave out the duplicates
as the file is being written.  If <span class="code">wordList</span> is the variable of
type <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</span> that holds the already sorted list of words,
then the following code will output the list without duplicates.  The idea is
that a word is written only if it is different from the previous word in the list.
Word number 0 is a special case, because there is no previous location in the list
in that case:</p>

<pre>for (int i = 0; i &lt; wordlist.size(); i++) {
   if (i == 0 || ! wordlist.get(i).equals(wordList.get(i-1) )  
      System.out.println(wordlist.get(i));
}</pre>

<p>This is actually the most efficient of the three solutions that I discuss, as
long as the sorting is done with an efficient method.  (For arrays, sorting
can be done using <span class="code">Arrays.sort()</span>.  I haven't discussed a similar
method for <span class="classname">ArrayLists</span>, but an <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</span>
can be sorted using a static method <span class="code">Collections.sort(list)</span> from the
class <span class="code">java.util.Collections</span>.)</p>

<p>A second approach to the problem would be to keep the list of words in sorted
order as it is being constructed.  This can be done by applying the <span class="code">insert()</span>
routine from <a href="../c7/s4.html#arrays.4.3">Subsection&nbsp;7.4.3</a> to insert each word into the list.</p>

<p>A third approach, and the one that I use in my solution, is to eliminate duplicates
from the list as it being constructed.  Each time a word is read from the input file,
I first check whether the word is already in the list.  If so, I discard it; if not,
I add it to the end of the list.  The function <span class="code">wordList.indexOf(word)</span>
can be used to test whether a given word is already in the list; this function returns
the value <span class="code">-1</span> if <span class="code">word</span> is not in the list.  After the
input file has been read, the list contains one copy of each word that was found
in the file.  At this point the list still has to be sorted.  I use a
selection sort algorithm (<a href="../c7/s4.html#arrays.4.4">Subsection&nbsp;7.4.4</a>), adapted to work for an <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>, 
to do the sorting. Then, all the elements of the list are output using a for-each loop:</p>

<pre>for (String w : wordList)
   TextIO.putln("   " + w);</pre>

<p>To let the user select the input and the output files, I use the methods
<span class="code">TextIO.readUserSelectedFile()</span> and <span class="code">TextIO.writeUserSelectedFile()</span>,
which are discussed in <a href="../c2/s4.html#basics.4.4">Subsection&nbsp;2.4.4</a>.  These methods put up a file
dialog where the user can select a file.  After the user selects an input file, <span class="code">TextIO</span>
reads from that file instead of from the user's input.  After the user selects an output
file, <span class="code">TextIO</span> writes to that file instead of to standard output.
If the user cancels the input file dialog,  then there is no input file to process, 
so I exit the program.  If the user cancels the output file dialog, I write the list of
words anyway&mdash;it will go to standard output so the user will see it on the screen.</p>

<p>When <span class="code">TextIO</span> is working with files and an error occurs, it will generate
an error of type <span class="classname">IllegalArgumentException</span>.  My program catches
the error if one occurs, and it prints an error message. An error is not very likely
in this case but one could occur if, for example, the user selects an input file that
the user does not have permission to read.</p>

<p>The complete code for my solution is shown below.</p>
