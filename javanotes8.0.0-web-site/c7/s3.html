<p>
<span class="start"><big>A</big>s we have just seen</span> in <a href="../c7/s2.html#arrays.2.4">Subsection&nbsp;7.2.4</a>,
we can easily encode the dynamic array pattern into a class, but it looks like
we need a different class for each data type.  In fact, Java has a feature called
"parameterized types" that makes it possible to avoid the multitude of classes, and
Java has a single class named <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> that implements the
dynamic array pattern for all data types.</p>
 


<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="arrays.3.1">7.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;ArrayList and Parameterized Types</a>
</h3>   


<p>Java has a standard type with the rather odd name <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</span> that represents
dynamic arrays of <span class="classname">Strings</span>.  Similarly, there is a type <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;Button&gt;</span>
that can be used to represent dynamic arrays of <span class="classname">Buttons</span>.  And if
<span class="classname">Player</span> is a class representing players in a game, then
the type <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;Player&gt;</span> can be used to represent a dynamic
array of <span class="classname">Players</span>.</p>


<p>It might look like we still have a multitude of classes here, but in fact there
is only one class, the <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> class, defined in the package
<span class="code">java.util</span>.  But <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> is a 
<span class="newword">parameterized type</span>.  A parameterized type can take a type
parameter, so that from the single class <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>,
we get a multitude of types including <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</span>,
<span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;Button&gt;</span>, and in fact <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;T&gt;</span>
for any object type <span class="classname">T</span>.  The type parameter <span class="classname">T</span>
must be an object type such as a class name or an interface name.  It cannot be
a primitive type.  This means that, unfortunately, you can not have an ArrayList of
<span class="ptype">int</span> or an ArrayList of <span class="ptype">char</span>.</p>


<p>Consider the type <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</span>.  As a type, it can
be used to declare variables, such as</p>


<pre>ArrayList&lt;String&gt; namelist;</pre>


<p>It can also be used as the type of a formal parameter in a subroutine definition,
or as the return type of a subroutine.  It can be used with the <span class="code">new</span>
operator to create objects:</p>


<pre>namelist = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();</pre>


<p>The object created in this way is of type <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</span> and
represents a dynamic list of strings.  It has instance methods such as
<span class="code">namelist.add(str)</span> for adding a <span class="classname">String</span> to the list,
<span class="code">namelist.get(i)</span> for getting the string at index <span class="code">i</span>,
and <span class="code">namelist.size()</span> for getting the number of items currently in the list.</p>


<p>But we can also use <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> with other types.
If <span class="classname">Player</span> is a class representing players in a game, we can
create a list of players with</p>


<pre>ArrayList&lt;Player&gt; playerList = new ArrayList&lt;Player&gt;();</pre>


<p>Then to add a player, <span class="code">plr</span>, to the game, we just have to say
<span class="code">playerList.add(plr)</span>.  And we can remove player number <span class="code">k</span>
with <span class="code">playerList.remove(k)</span>.</p>


<p>When you use a type such as <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;T&gt;</span>, the compiler will
ensure that only objects of type <span class="classname">T</span> can be added to the list.
An attempt to add an object that is not of type <span class="classname">T</span> will be
a syntax error, and the program will not compile.  However, note that objects
belonging to a subclass of <span class="classname">T</span> can be added to the list, since
objects belonging to a subclass of <span class="classname">T</span> are still considered to
be of type <span class="classname">T</span>. Thus, for example, a variable of type
<span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;Pane&gt;</span> can be used to hold objects of type
<span class="classname">BorderPane</span>, <span class="classname">TilePane</span>, <span class="classname">GridPane</span>,
or any other subclass of <span class="classname">Pane</span>.
(Of course, this is the same way arrays work:  An object of type <span class="atype">T[]</span>
can hold objects belonging to any subclass of <span class="classname">T</span>.)
Similarly, if <span class="classname">T</span> is an interface, then any object that 
implements interface <span class="classname">T</span> can be added to the list.</p>


<p>An object of type <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;T&gt;</span> has all of the instance methods
that you would expect in a dynamic array implementation.  Here are some of the most
useful.  Suppose that <span class="code">list</span> is a variable of type <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;T&gt;</span>.
Then we have:</p>


<ul>

<li>
<span class="codedef">list.size()</span> &mdash; This function returns
the current size of the list, that is, the number of items currently in the list. 
The only valid positions in the
list are numbers in the range <span class="code">0</span> to <span class="code">list.size()-1</span>. Note that
the size can be zero. A call to the default constructor <span class="code">new&nbsp;ArrayList&lt;T&gt;()</span> 
creates a list of size zero.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">list.add(obj)</span> &mdash; Adds an object onto
the end of the list, increasing the size by&nbsp;1. The parameter,
<span class="code">obj</span>, can refer to an object of type <span class="classname">T</span>, 
or it can be <span class="code">null</span>.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">list.get(N)</span> &mdash; This function returns
the value stored at position <span class="code">N</span> in the list.  The return type of
this function is&nbsp;<span class="classname">T</span>.&nbsp; <span class="code">N</span>
must be an integer in the range <span class="code">0</span> to <span class="code">list.size()-1</span>. If
<span class="code">N</span> is outside this range, an error of type <span class="classname">IndexOutOfBoundsException</span>
occurs. Calling this function is
similar to referring to <span class="code">A[N]</span> for an array, <span class="code">A</span>, except that you
can't use <span class="code">list.get(N)</span> on the left side of an assignment statement.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">list.set(N, obj)</span> &mdash; Assigns the
object, <span class="code">obj</span>, to position <span class="code">N</span> in the <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>,
replacing the item previously stored at position <span class="code">N</span>. The parameter <span class="code">obj</span>
must be of type <span class="classname">T</span>.  The integer
<span class="code">N</span> must be in the range from <span class="code">0</span> to <span class="code">list.size()-1</span>. A
call to this function is equivalent to the command <span class="code">A[N]&nbsp;=&nbsp;obj</span> for an
array&nbsp;<span class="code">A</span>.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">list.clear()</span> &mdash; Removes all items from the list, setting its size
to zero.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">list.remove(N)</span> &mdash; For an integer,
<span class="code">N</span>, this removes the <span class="code">N-th</span> item in the <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>.
<span class="code">N</span> must be in the range <span class="code">0</span> to <span class="code">list.size()-1</span>. Any items
in the list that come after the removed item are moved up one position. The
size of the list decreases by 1.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">list.remove(obj)</span> &mdash; If the specified
object occurs somewhere in the list, it is removed from the list.
Any items in the list that come after the removed item are moved up one
position. The size of the <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> decreases by 1. If <span class="code">obj</span>
occurs more than once in the list, only the first copy is removed.  If <span class="code">obj</span>
does not occur in the list, nothing happens; this is not an error.</li>

<li>
<span class="codedef">list.indexOf(obj)</span> &mdash; A function that
searches for the object, <span class="code">obj</span>, in the list. If the object
is found in the list, then the first position number where it is found is returned.
If the object is not found, then <span class="code">-1</span> is returned.</li>

</ul>


<p>For the last two methods listed here, <span class="code">obj</span> is compared to
an item in the list by calling <span class="code">obj.equals(item)</span>, unless <span class="code">obj</span>
is null.  This means, for example, that strings are tested for equality by checking
the contents of the strings, not their location in memory.</p>


<p>Java comes with several parameterized classes representing different data structures.
Those classes make up the <span class="newword">Java Collection Framework</span>.  Here we consider
only <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>, but we will return to this important topic in
much more detail in <a href="../c10/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;10</a>.</p>


<p>By the way, <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> can also be used as a non-parametrized
type.  This means that you can declare variables and create objects of type <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>
such as</p>


<pre>ArrayList list = new ArrayList();</pre>


<p>The effect of this is similar to declaring <span class="code">list</span> to be of type
<span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;Object&gt;</span>.  That is, <span class="code">list</span> can hold
any object that belongs to a subclass of <span class="classname">Object</span>.  Since every
class is a subclass of <span class="classname">Object</span>, this means that <b>any</b>
object can be stored in <span class="code">list</span>.</p>

<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="arrays.3.2">7.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapper Classes</a>
</h3>
   

<p>As I have already noted, parameterized types don't work with the primitive types.
There is no such thing as "<span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;int&gt;</span>".  However, this limitation
turns out not to be very limiting after all, because of the so-called
<span class="newword">wrapper classes</span> such as <span class="classname">Integer</span>
and <span class="classname">Character</span>.</p>
 

<p>We have already briefly encountered the classes <span class="classname">Double</span> and
<span class="classname">Integer</span> in <a href="../c2/s5.html">Section&nbsp;2.5</a>.  These classes
contain the <span class="code">static</span> methods <span class="code">Double.parseDouble()</span>
and <span class="code">Integer.parseInteger()</span> that are used to convert strings to
numerical values, and they contain constants such as <span class="code">Integer.MAX_VALUE</span> and <span class="code">Double.NaN</span>.
We have also encountered the <span class="classname">Character</span>
class in some examples, with the static method <span class="code">Character.isLetter()</span>,
that can be used to test whether a given value of type <span class="code">char</span> is a
letter.  There is a similar class for each of the other primitive types,
<span class="classname">Long</span>, <span class="classname">Short</span>, <span class="classname">Byte</span>, 
<span class="classname">Float</span>, and <span class="classname">Boolean</span>.
These classes are wrapper classes.  Although they
contain useful <span class="code">static</span> members, they have another use as
well:  They are used for representing primitive type
values as objects.</p>
   

<p>Remember that the primitive types are not classes, and values of primitive type
are not objects.  However, sometimes it's useful to treat a primitive value
as if it were an object.  This is true, for example, when you would like to store
primitive type values in an <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>.
You can't do that literally, but you can "wrap" the
primitive type value in an object belonging to one of the wrapper classes.</p>
   

<p>For example, an object of type <span class="classname">Double</span> contains a single instance
variable, of type <span class="ptype">double</span>.  The object is a "wrapper" 
for the <span class="ptype">double</span> value.  You can create an object that
wraps the <span class="ptype">double</span> value <span class="code">6.0221415e23</span> with</p>
   

<pre>Double d = new Double(6.0221415e23);</pre>
   

<p>The value of <span class="code">d</span> contains the same information as the value of type
<span class="ptype">double</span>, but it is an object.   If you want to retrieve the <span class="ptype">double</span>
value that is wrapped in the object, you can call the function <span class="code">d.doubleValue()</span>.
Similarly, you can wrap an <span class="ptype">int</span>
in an object of type <span class="classname">Integer</span>, a <span class="ptype">boolean</span> value
in an object of type <span class="classname">Boolean</span>, and so on.</p>


<p>Actually, instead of calling the constructor, <span class="code">new Double(x)</span>,
it is preferable to use the static method <span class="code">Double.valueOf(x)</span>,
which does essentially the same thing; that is, it returns an object of
type <span class="classname">Double</span> that wraps the <span class="ptype">double</span>
value&nbsp;<span class="code">x</span>.  The advantage is that if <span class="code">Double.valueOf()</span>
is called more than once with the same parameter, value, it has the option
of returning the same object each time.  After the first call with that parameter,
it can reuse the same object in subsequent calls with the same parameter.
This is OK because objects of type <span class="classname">Double</span> are
immutable, so two objects that start out with the same value are guaranteed to be
identical forever.  <span class="code">Double.valueOf</span> is a kind of "factory method"
like those we saw for <span class="classname">Color</span> and <span class="classname">Font</span>
in <a href="../c6/s2.html">Section&nbsp;6.2</a>.  Each of the wrapper classes has a similar
factory method:  <span class="code">Integer.valueOf(n)</span>, <span class="code">Character.valueOf(ch)</span>,
and so on.</p>


<hr class="break">
   

<p>To make the wrapper classes even easier to use, there is automatic
conversion between a primitive type and the corresponding wrapper class.  For example,
if you use a value of type <span class="ptype">int</span> in a context that requires an object
of type <span class="classname">Integer</span>, the <span class="ptype">int</span> will automatically be
wrapped in an <span class="classname">Integer</span> object. If you say</p>
   

<pre>Integer answer = 42;</pre>
   

<p>the computer will silently read this as if it were</p>
   

<pre>Integer answer = Integer.valueOf(42);</pre>
   

<p>This is called <span class="newword">autoboxing</span>.   It works in the other direction, too. For example, if
<span class="code">d</span> refers to an object of type <span class="code">Double</span>, you can use <span class="code">d</span>
in a numerical expression such as <span class="code">2*d</span>.  The <span class="ptype">double</span> value inside
<span class="code">d</span> is automatically <span class="newword">unboxed</span> and multiplied by&nbsp;2.  Autoboxing
and unboxing also apply to subroutine calls.  For example, you can pass an actual parameter of type
<span class="ptype">int</span> to a subroutine that has a formal parameter of type <span class="classname">Integer</span>,
and vice versa.  In fact, autoboxing and unboxing make it possible in many circumstances to ignore the difference
between primitive types and objects.</p>
 

<p>This is true in particular for parameterized types.  Although there is no such thing
as "<span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;int&gt;</span>", there is <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;</span>.
An <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;</span> holds objects of type <span class="classname">Integer</span>,
but any object of type <span class="classname">Integer</span> really just represents an <span class="ptype">int</span>
value in a rather thin wrapper.  Suppose that we have an object of type 
<span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;</span>:</p>


<pre>ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; integerList;
integerList = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();</pre>


<p>Then we can, for example, add an object to <span class="code">integerList</span> that represents the number 42:</p>
  

<pre>integerList.add( Integer.valueOf(42) );</pre>


<p>but because of autoboxing, we can actually say</p>


<pre>integerList.add( 42 );</pre>


<p>and the compiler will automatically wrap 42 in an object of type <span class="classname">Integer</span>
before adding it to the list.  Similarly, we can say</p>


<pre>int num = integerList.get(3);</pre>


<p>The value returned by <span class="code">integerList.get(3)</span> is of type <span class="classname">Integer</span>
but because of unboxing, the compiler will automatically convert the return value into an
<span class="ptype">int</span>, as if we had said</p>


<pre>int num = integerList.get(3)<span class="newcode">.intValue()</span>;</pre>


<p>So, in effect, we can pretty much use <span class="code">integerList</span> as if it were
a dynamic array of <span class="ptype">int</span> rather than a dynamic array of <span class="classname">Integer</span>.
Of course, a similar statement holds for lists of other wrapper classes such as
<span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;Double&gt;</span> and <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;Character&gt;</span>.
(There is one issue that sometimes causes problems:  A list can hold <span class="code">null</span>
values, and a <span class="code">null</span> does not correspond to any primitive type value.  This
means, for example, that the statement "<span class="code">int num = integerList.get(3);</span>"
can produce a null pointer exception in the case where <span class="code">integerList.get(3)</span>
returns <span class="code">null</span>.  Unless you are sure that all the values in your list are
non-null, you need to take this possibility into account.)
</p>





<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="arrays.3.3">7.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Programming With ArrayList</a>
</h3>


<p>As a simple first example, we can redo <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter7/ReverseWithDynamicArray.java">ReverseWithDynamicArray.java</a></span>,
from the <a href="../c7/s2.html#arrays.2.4">previous section</a>, using an
ArrayList instead of a custom dynamic array class.  In this case, we want
to store integers in the list, so we should use <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;</span>.
Here is the complete program:</p>
   

<pre>import textio.TextIO;
import java.util.ArrayList;

/**
 * Reads a list of non-zero numbers from the user, then prints
 * out the input numbers in the reverse of the order in which
 * the were entered.  There is no limit on the number of inputs.
 */
public class ReverseWithArrayList {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        <span class="newcode">ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; list;
        list = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();</span>
        System.out.println("Enter some non-zero integers.  Enter 0 to end.");
        while (true) {
            System.out.print("? ");
            int number = TextIO.getlnInt();
            if (number == 0)
                break;
            <span class="newcode">list.add(number);</span>
        }
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("Your numbers in reverse are:");
        for (int i = <span class="newcode">list.size()</span> - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {
            System.out.printf("%10d%n", <span class="newcode">list.get(i)</span>);
        }
    }

}</pre>


<p>As illustrated in this example, ArrayLists are commonly processed using
<span class="code">for</span> loops, in much the same way that arrays are processed.
for example, the following loop prints out all the items for a variable <span class="code">namelist</span> of type
<span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</span>:</p>


<pre>for ( int i = 0; i &lt; namelist.size(); i++ ) {
    String item = namelist.get(i);
    System.out.println(item);
}</pre>


<p>You can also use for-each loops with ArrayLists, so this example could also be written</p>


<pre>for ( String item : namelist ) {
    System.out.println(item);
}</pre>


<p>When working with wrapper classes, the loop control variable in the for-each loop
can be a primitive type variable.  This works because of unboxing.  For example,
if <span class="code">numbers</span> is of type <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;Double&gt;</span>, then
the following loop can be used to add up all the values in the list:</p>
  

<pre>double sum = 0;
for ( double num : numbers ) {
   sum = sum + num;
}</pre>


<p>This will work as long as none of the items in the list are <span class="code">null</span>.
If there is a possibility of null values, then you will want to use a loop control
variable of type <span class="classname">Double</span> and test for nulls.  For example,
to add up all the non-null values in the list:</p>
 

<pre>double sum;
for ( Double num : numbers ) {
    if ( num != null ) {
        sum = sum + num;  // Here, num is SAFELY unboxed to get a double.
    }
}</pre> 


<hr class="break">


<p>For a more complete and useful example, we will look at the program
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter7/SimplePaint2.java">SimplePaint2.java</a></span>.  This is a much improved version of
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter6/SimplePaint.java">SimplePaint.java</a></span> from <a href="../c6/s3.html#GUI1.3.3">Subsection&nbsp;6.3.3</a>.
In the new program, the user can sketch curves in a drawing area
by clicking and dragging with the mouse.
The user can select the drawing color using a menu.  The background color of the
drawing area can also be selected using a menu.  And there is a "Control"
menu that contains several commands:  An "Undo" command, which removes the
most recently drawn curve from the screen, a "Clear" command that removes
all the curves, and a "Use Symmetry" checkbox that turns a symmetry feature
on and off. Curves that are drawn by the user when the symmetry option is on
are reflected horizontally and vertically to produce a symmetric pattern.
(Symmetry is there just to look pretty.)</p>


<p>Unlike the original SimplePaint program, this new version
uses a data structure to store information about the picture that has been
drawn by the user. When the user selects a new background color, the canvas
is filled with the new background color, and all of the curves that were 
there previously are redrawn on the new background.  To do that, we need to
store enough data to redraw all of the curves.  Similarly, the Undo
command is implemented by deleting the data for most recently drawn curve,
and then redrawing the entire picture using the remaining data.</p>  


<p>The data structure that we need is implemented using <span class="classname">ArrayLists</span>.
The main data for a curve consists of a list of the points on the curve.  This
data is stored in an object of type <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;Point2D&gt;</span>.
(<span class="classname">Point2D</span> is standard class in package <span class="code">javafx.geometry</span>.
A <span class="classname">Point2D</span> can be constructed from two <span class="ptype">double</span>
values, giving the (x,y) coordinates of a point.  A <span class="classname">Point2D</span>
object, <span class="code">pt</span>, has getter methods <span class="code">pt.getX()</span> and <span class="code">pt.getY()</span>
that return the x and y coordinates.)  But in addition to a list of points
on a curve, to redraw the curve, we also need to know its color,
and we need to know whether the symmetry option should be applied to the curve.
All the data that is needed to redraw the curve is grouped into
an object of type <span class="classname">CurveData</span> that is defined 
as a nested class in the program:</p>
   

<pre>private static class CurveData {
   Color color;  // The color of the curve.
   boolean symmetric;  // Are horizontal and vertical reflections also drawn?
   ArrayList&lt;Point2D&gt; points;  // The points on the curve.
}</pre>
   

<p>However, a picture can contain many curves, not just one, so to store
all the data necessary to redraw the entire picture, we need a <b>list</b>
of objects of type <span class="classname">CurveData</span>.  For this list,
the program uses an <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>, <span class="code">curves</span>, declared as</p>
   

<pre>ArrayList&lt;CurveData&gt; curves = new ArrayList&lt;CurveData&gt;();</pre>
   

<p>Here we have a list of objects, where each object contains a list of
points as part of its data!  Let's look at a few examples of processing
this data structure.  When the user clicks the mouse on the drawing surface,
it's the start of a new curve, and a new <span class="classname">CurveData</span>
object must be created.  The instance
variables in the new <span class="classname">CurveData</span> object must
also be initialized.  Here is the code from the <span class="code">mousePressed()</span>
routine that does this, where <span class="code">currentCurve</span> is a global
variable of type <span class="code">CurveData</span>:</p>
     

<pre>currentCurve = new CurveData();       // Create a new CurveData object.

currentCurve.color = currentColor;    // The color of a curve is taken from an
                                      // instance variable that represents the
                                      // currently selected drawing color.

currentCurve.symmetric = useSymmetry; // The "symmetric" property of the curve
                                      // is also copied from the current value
                                      // of an instance variable, useSymmetry.

currentCurve.points = new ArrayList&lt;Point2D&gt;();  // A new point list object.</pre>


<p>As the user drags the mouse, new points are added to <span class="code">currentCurve</span>,
and line segments of the curve are drawn between points as they are added.  When the
user releases the mouse, the curve is complete, and it is added to
the list of curves by calling</p>


<pre>curves.add( currentCurve );</pre>


<p>When the user changes the background color or selects the "Undo" command,
the picture has to be redrawn.  The program has a <span class="code">redraw()</span>
method that completely redraws the picture. That method uses the data in <span class="code">curves</span>
to draw all the curves.  The basic structure is a for-each loop that processes
the data for each individual curve in turn.  This has the form:</p>
   

<pre>for ( CurveData curve : curves ) {
   .
   .  // Draw the curve represented by the object, curve, of type CurveData.
   .  
}</pre>
   

<p>In the body of this loop, <span class="code">curve.points</span> is a variable of
type <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;Point2D&gt;</span> that holds the list of 
points on the curve.  The <span class="code">i-th</span> point on the curve can be
obtained by calling the <span class="code">get()</span> method of this list:
<span class="code">curve.points.get(i)</span>.  This returns a value of type
<span class="classname">Point2D</span> which has getter methods named
<span class="code">getX()</span> and <span class="code">getY()</span>.  We can refer directly to the
x-coordinate of the <span class="code">i-th</span> point as:</p>
   

<pre>curve.points.get(i).getX()</pre>
   

<p>This might seem rather complicated, but it's a nice example of a complex name
that specifies a path to a desired piece of data: Go to the object, <span class="code">curve</span>.
Inside <span class="code">curve</span>, go to <span class="code">points</span>.  Inside <span class="code">points</span>,
get the <span class="code">i-th</span> item.  And from that item, get the x coordinate
by calling its <span class="code">getX()</span> method.  Here is the complete definition of the
method that redraws the picture:</p>
   

<pre>private void redraw() {
    g.setFill(backgroundColor);
    g.fillRect(0,0,canvas.getWidth(),canvas.getHeight());
    for ( CurveData curve : curves ) {
        g.setStroke(curve.color);
        for (int i = 1; i &lt; curve.points.size(); i++) {
                // Draw a line segment from point number i-1 to point number i.
            double x1 = curve.points.get(i-1).getX();
            double y1 = curve.points.get(i-1).getY();
            double x2 = curve.points.get(i).getX();
            double y2 = curve.points.get(i).getY();
            drawSegment(curve.symmetric,x1,y1,x2,y2);
        }
    }
}</pre>


<p>
<span class="code">drawSegment()</span> is a method that strokes the line segment
from <span class="code">(x1,y1)</span> to <span class="code">(x2,y2)</span>.  If the first parameter is
<span class="code">true</span>, it also draws the horizontal and vertical reflections of
that segment.</p>
   

<p>I have mostly been interested here in discussing how the program uses
<span class="classname">ArrayList</span>, but
I encourage you to read the full source code, <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter7/SimplePaint2.java">SimplePaint2.java</a></span>,
and to try out the program.
In addition to serving as an example of using parameterized types, it also serves
as another example of creating and using menus.  You should be able to understand
the entire program.</p>
