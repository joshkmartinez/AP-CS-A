<h2>Programming Exercises for Chapter 7</h2>
<hr class="break">
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> several exercises for Chapter 7
        in <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.  For each exercise, a link to
        a possible solution is provided.   Each solution includes a discussion of how a programmer might approach the
        problem and interesting points raised by the problem or its solution, as well as complete source
        code of the solution.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 7.1:</h3>
<p>Write a subroutine that creates an ArrayList containing several <i>different</i>
random integers in the range from 1 up to some specified maximum.  The number of integers and the
maximum allowed value for the integers should be parameters to the subroutine.  Write a <span class="code">main()</span>
routine to test your subroutine.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 7.2:</h3>
<p>Suppose that <span class="code">M</span> is a two-dimensional array that
has <span class="code">R</span> rows and <span class="code">C</span> columns.  The <span class="newword">transpose</span>
of <span class="code">M</span> is defined to be an array <span class="code">T</span> that has <span class="code">C</span> rows
and <span class="code">R</span> columns such that <span class="code">T[i][j]&nbsp;=&nbsp;M[j][i]</span> for 
each <span class="code">i</span> and <span class="code">j</span>.  Write a function that takes an array
of type <span class="atype">int[][]</span> as a parameter, and returns the transpose of that array.
(Assume that the parameter is a typical 2D array in which all the rows have the same length.)
Also write a subroutine to print a 2D array of integers in neat rows and columns, and
include a <span class="code">main()</span> routine to test your work.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 7.3:</h3>
<p>In <a href="../c7/s4.html#arrays.4.4">Subsection&nbsp;7.4.4</a>, it is mentioned that the
standard sorting method <span class="code">Arrays.sort()</span> is much faster and efficient
than selection sort.  Write a program to test this claim.  To be specific, your
program should create a large array filled with random real numbers.  It should
use both <span class="code">Arrays.sort()</span> and <span class="code">selectionSort()</span> to sort
the array, and it should time how long it takes to perform each sort.  Furthermore,
it should do the same thing for a large array of random <span class="classname">Strings</span>.
To find the times, you can use <span class="code">System.nanoTime()</span>
(see <a href="../c2/s3.html#basics.3.1">Subsection&nbsp;2.3.1</a> and the example <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter2/TimedComputation.java">TimedComputation.java</a></span>).</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 7.4:</h3>
<p>In <a href="../c6/ex2-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;6.2</a>, you wrote a
program <span class="code">DragTwoSquares</span> that allows the user to
drag a red square and a blue square around on a canvas.  Write an
much improved version where the user can add squares to a canvas
and drag them around.  In particular: If the user shift-clicks
or right-clicks the canvas, then the user is trying to drag a
square; find the square that contains the mouse position, if any,
and move it as the user drags the mouse.  Other clicks should
add squares.  You can place the center of the new square at
the current mouse position.  To make the picture more visually
appealing, give each square a random color, and when you draw
the squares, draw a black outline around each square.  (My program
also gives the square a random alpha value between 0.5 and 1.0).</p>

<p>Write a class to represent the data needed for drawing one square,
and use an <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> to store the data for
all the squares in the picture.  If the user drags a square 
completely off the canvas, delete it from the list.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 7.5:</h3>
<p>Write a program that will
read a sequence of positive real numbers entered by the user and will print the
same numbers in sorted order from smallest to largest. The user will input a
zero to mark the end of the input. Assume that at most 100 positive numbers
will be entered.  Do <b>not</b> use any built-in function such as 
<span class="code">Arrays.sort()</span>. Do the sorting yourself.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 7.6:</h3>
<p>Write a program that will read a text file selected by the user,
and will make an alphabetical list of all the different words in that file.  All words
should be converted to lower case, and duplicates should be eliminated from the list.
The list should be written to an output file selected by the user.  As discussed
in <a href="../c2/s4.html#basics.4.4">Subsection&nbsp;2.4.4</a>, you can use <span class="classname">TextIO</span> to read and
write files.  Use a variable of type <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</span> to
store the words.  It is not easy to separate a file into words as you are reading
it, especially if you want to allow apostrophes in the middle of a word.  
You can use the following method in your program:</p>

<pre>/**
 * Read the next word from TextIO, if there is one.  First, skip past
 * any non-letters in the input.  If an end-of-file is encountered before 
 * a word is found, return null.  Otherwise, read and return the word.
 * A word is defined as a sequence of letters.  Also, a word can include
 * an apostrophe if the apostrophe is surrounded by letters on each side.
 * @return the next word from TextIO, or null if an end-of-file is 
 *     encountered
 */
private static String readNextWord() {
   char ch = TextIO.peek(); // Look at next character in input.
   while (ch != TextIO.EOF &amp;&amp; ! Character.isLetter(ch)) {
          // Skip past non-letters.
      TextIO.getAnyChar();  // Read the character.
      ch = TextIO.peek();   // Look at the next character.
   }
   if (ch == TextIO.EOF) // Encountered end-of-file
      return null;
   // At this point, we know the next character is a letter, so read a word.
   String word = "";  // This will be the word that is read.
   while (true) {
      word += TextIO.getAnyChar();  // Append the letter onto word.
      ch = TextIO.peek();  // Look at next character.
      if ( ch == '\'' ) {
            // The next character is an apostrophe.  Read it, and
            // if the following character is a letter, add both the
            // apostrophe and the letter onto the word and continue
            // reading the word.  If the character after the apostrophe
            // is not a letter, the word is done, so break out of the loop.
         TextIO.getAnyChar();   // Read the apostrophe.
         ch = TextIO.peek();    // Look at char that follows apostrophe.
         if (Character.isLetter(ch)) {
            word += "\'" + TextIO.getAnyChar();
            ch = TextIO.peek();  // Look at next char.
         }
         else
            break;
      }
      if ( ! Character.isLetter(ch) ) {
            // If the next character is not a letter, the word is
            // finished, so break out of the loop.
         break;
      }
      // If we haven't broken out of the loop, next char is a letter.
   }
   return word;  // Return the word that has been read.
}</pre>

<p>Note that this method will return <span class="code">null</span> when the file has been
entirely read.  You can use this as a signal to stop processing the input file.</p>

<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 7.7:</h3>
<p>The game of Go Moku (also
known as Pente or Five Stones) is similar to Tic-Tac-Toe, except that it is played
on a much larger board and the object is to get five squares in a row rather
than three.  The board should have 13 rows and 13 columns of squares.
Players take turns placing pieces on a board. A piece can be placed
in any empty square. The first player to get five pieces in a row&mdash;horizontally, 
vertically, or diagonally&mdash;wins. If all squares are filled
before either player wins, then the game is a draw. Write a program that lets
two players play Go Moku against each other.</p>


<p>Your program will be simpler than the <span class="classname">Checkers</span> program from
<a href="../c7/s5.html#arrays.5.3">Subsection&nbsp;7.5.3</a>. Play alternates strictly between the two players,
and there is no need to highlight the legal moves. You will only need one
nested subclass, a subclass of <span class="classname">Canvas</span> to draw
the board and do all the work of the game, like the nested <span class="classname">CheckersBoard</span>
in the <span class="classname">Chekers</span> program.  You will probably want
to look at the source code for the checkers program,
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter7/Checkers.java">Checkers.java</a></span>, for ideas about the general
outline of the program.</p>


<p>The hardest part of the program is checking whether the move that a player
makes is a winning move. To do this, you have to look in each of the four
possible directions from the square where the user has placed a piece. You have
to count how many pieces that player has in a row in that direction. If the
number is five or more in any direction, then that player wins. As a hint, here
is part of the code from my program. This code counts the number of pieces that
the user has in a row in a specified direction. The direction is specified by
two integers, <span class="code">dirX</span> and <span class="code">dirY</span>. The values of these variables
are 0, 1, or -1, and at least one of them is non-zero. For example, to look in
the horizontal direction, <span class="code">dirX</span> is 1 and <span class="code">dirY</span> is 0.</p>


<pre>int ct = 1;  // Number of pieces in a row belonging to the player.

int r, c;    // A row and column to be examined

r = row + dirX;  // Look at square in specified direction.
c = col + dirY;
while ( r &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; r &lt; 13 &amp;&amp; c &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; c &lt; 13 
                                  &amp;&amp; board[r][c] == player ) {
        // Square is on the board, and it 
        // contains one of the player's pieces.
   ct++;
   r += dirX;  // Go on to next square in this direction.
   c += dirY;
}

r = row - dirX;  // Now, look in the opposite direction.
c = col - dirY;
while ( r &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; r &lt; 13 &amp;&amp; c &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; c &lt; 13 
                                 &amp;&amp; board[r][c] == player ) {
   ct++;
   r -= dirX;   // Go on to next square in this direction.
   c -= dirY;
}</pre>


<p>Here is a picture of my program, just after black has won the game.</p>
