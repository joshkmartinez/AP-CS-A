<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 7.5:</h3>
<p>Write a program that will
read a sequence of positive real numbers entered by the user and will print the
same numbers in sorted order from smallest to largest. The user will input a
zero to mark the end of the input. Assume that at most 100 positive numbers
will be entered.  Do <b>not</b> use any built-in function such as 
<span class="code">Arrays.sort()</span>. Do the sorting yourself.</p>

<p>The sample program 
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter7/ReverseWithDynamicArray.java">ReverseWithDynamicArray.java</a></span> from
<a href="../c7/s2.html#arrays.2.4">Subsection&nbsp;7.2.4</a> reads in up to 100 positive integers from the
user and outputs them in the reverse of the order in which the user entered
them. This is similar to what we have to do for this exercise, except that the
numbers we have to read are real numbers (of type <span class="ptype">double</span>) and they
have to be output in sorted order.</p>


<p>There are two basic approaches to this problem. The first is to store all
the numbers in an array in the order in which they are input. After all the
numbers have been input, the array can be sorted, and then the contents of the
array can be output. The second approach is to always keep the array in sorted
order as numbers are added to it. When a new number is input, that number must
be inserted into its correct location in the array, in order to keep the array
sorted. After all the numbers have been input, the contents of the array are
ready to be printed.</p>


<p>Two solutions to the exercise, based on these two approaches, are shown
below. They use techniques for sorting and inserting that were covered in
<a href="../c7/s4.html">Section&nbsp;7.4</a>. In my first program, I've chosen to use
Selection Sort to sort the array. Insertion Sort would work just as well. The
Selection Sort subroutine is taken from <a href="../c7/s4.html">Section&nbsp;7.4</a> with two changes: It sorts
an array of <span class="ptype">double</span> values instead of an array of <span class="code">ints</span>, and it
has been modified to work with a "partially full" array. In order to make the
subroutine work with a partially full array, it is necessary to add a parameter
that tells the subroutine how many entries in the array are in use. The
modified Selection Sort routine is as follows, with changes from the original
version shown in red</p>


<pre>static void selectionSort(<span class="newcode">double</span>[] A, <span class="newword">int count</span>) {
      // Sort the numbers in A[0], A[1], ..., A[count-1] into
      // increasing order using Selection Sort.
   for ( int lastPlace = <span class="newcode">count</span> - 1; lastPlace &gt; 0; lastPlace-- ) {
      int maxLoc = 0;
      for (int j = 1; j &lt;= lastPlace; j++) {
         if (A[j] &gt; A[maxLoc]) {
            maxLoc = j;
         }
      }
      <span class="newcode">double</span> temp = A[maxLoc];
      A[maxLoc] = A[lastPlace];
      A[lastPlace] = temp;
   }
} // end selectionSort</pre>


<p>In the first version of the program, this subroutine is called just after
all the numbers have been input from the user.</p>


<p>The second version of the program is straightforward. It uses the
<span class="code">insert()</span> subroutine from <a href="../c7/s4.html">Section&nbsp;7.4</a>, modified to work with an array
of <span class="code">doubles</span> instead of an array of <span class="code">ints</span>.</p>
