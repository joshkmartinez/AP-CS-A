<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 7.7:</h3>
<p>The game of Go Moku (also
known as Pente or Five Stones) is similar to Tic-Tac-Toe, except that it is played
on a much larger board and the object is to get five squares in a row rather
than three.  The board should have 13 rows and 13 columns of squares.
Players take turns placing pieces on a board. A piece can be placed
in any empty square. The first player to get five pieces in a row&mdash;horizontally, 
vertically, or diagonally&mdash;wins. If all squares are filled
before either player wins, then the game is a draw. Write a program that lets
two players play Go Moku against each other.</p>


<p>Your program will be simpler than the <span class="classname">Checkers</span> program from
<a href="../c7/s5.html#arrays.5.3">Subsection&nbsp;7.5.3</a>. Play alternates strictly between the two players,
and there is no need to highlight the legal moves. You will only need one
nested subclass, a subclass of <span class="classname">Canvas</span> to draw
the board and do all the work of the game, like the nested <span class="classname">CheckersBoard</span>
in the <span class="classname">Chekers</span> program.  You will probably want
to look at the source code for the checkers program,
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter7/Checkers.java">Checkers.java</a></span>, for ideas about the general
outline of the program.</p>


<p>The hardest part of the program is checking whether the move that a player
makes is a winning move. To do this, you have to look in each of the four
possible directions from the square where the user has placed a piece. You have
to count how many pieces that player has in a row in that direction. If the
number is five or more in any direction, then that player wins. As a hint, here
is part of the code from my program. This code counts the number of pieces that
the user has in a row in a specified direction. The direction is specified by
two integers, <span class="code">dirX</span> and <span class="code">dirY</span>. The values of these variables
are 0, 1, or -1, and at least one of them is non-zero. For example, to look in
the horizontal direction, <span class="code">dirX</span> is 1 and <span class="code">dirY</span> is 0.</p>


<pre>int ct = 1;  // Number of pieces in a row belonging to the player.

int r, c;    // A row and column to be examined

r = row + dirX;  // Look at square in specified direction.
c = col + dirY;
while ( r &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; r &lt; 13 &amp;&amp; c &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; c &lt; 13 
                                  &amp;&amp; board[r][c] == player ) {
        // Square is on the board, and it 
        // contains one of the player's pieces.
   ct++;
   r += dirX;  // Go on to next square in this direction.
   c += dirY;
}

r = row - dirX;  // Now, look in the opposite direction.
c = col - dirY;
while ( r &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; r &lt; 13 &amp;&amp; c &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; c &lt; 13 
                                 &amp;&amp; board[r][c] == player ) {
   ct++;
   r -= dirX;   // Go on to next square in this direction.
   c -= dirY;
}</pre>

<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr>
<p>This is a fairly complicated program, but it's possible to design and build
it in stages, testing each stage separately. The first stage, the general
layout of the panel, is already done in the 
<span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter7/Checkers.java">Checkers.java</a></span> program. With just a few changes, the
main panel class, the layout of the panel, and the button and message
handling come directly from that program. Let's take the rest of the Go&nbsp;Moku
game one stage at a time.</p>


<p>A two-dimensional array is used to store the contents of the board. This
array is of type <span class="atype">int[][]</span> and is named <span class="code">board</span>. It is defined as
an instance variable in the <span class="classname">Board</span> class, and it is initialized
in the constructor of that class to be a 13-by-13 array. The value in each
position of the array is one of three constants: <span class="code">EMPTY</span>,
<span class="code">WHITE</span>, or <span class="code">BLACK</span>. When a game begins, each of the entries in
the array is set to empty. When a player clicks on an empty square, the
corresponding entry in the array is changed from <span class="code">EMPTY</span> to 
<span class="code">BLACK</span> or <span class="code">WHITE</span>, depending on which player placed the piece. 
In the <span class="code">drawBoard()</span>
method, the contents of the <span class="code">board</span> array are used to decide what pieces
to draw on the board.</p>




<p>
<b><u>Drawing the Board</u></b>
</p>


<p>We need a <span class="code">drawBoard()</span> method for the <span class="classname">Board</span> class that
can draw the board. The board has 13 rows and 13 columns of spaces. How wide
should the board be? If each square in the board is <span class="code">x</span> pixels wide, we
need a total of <span class="code">13*x</span> pixels just for the spaces. But there are also
lines between the spaces and at the edges of the board. I make each line two pixels wide, so the 14 lines
require another 28 pixels.  So, with
squares of side <span class="code">x</span>, we need a board that is <span class="code">13*x+28</span> pixels
wide. Since I wanted something about the same size as the original
checkerboard, which was 324 pixels, I choose <span class="code">x</span> to be 22, giving a board width of 314 pixels. The
height is also 314.</p>


<p>The left edge of the <span class="code">col</span>-th column of squares in the board is
<span class="code">2+24*col</span>. This allows for the two-pixel border on the left and for 24
pixels for each of the preceding columns of squares. (That's 22 pixels for the
square plus two pixels for the line between that column and the next.) The lines
at <span class="code">x</span> values <span class="code">1&nbsp;+&nbsp;24*i</span>, for <span class="code">i</span> from 0 to 13. 
This puts the center of the pen that is used to draw the line in the correct position,
one pixel to the left of each column for the first 13 lines, and one pixel from the right edge of the canvas
for the final line.   Rows work the
same way. To draw a piece in row number <span class="code">row</span> and column number
<span class="code">col</span>, the command</p>


<pre>g.fillOval(4 + 24*col, 4 + 24*row, 18, 18);</pre>


<p>can be used. This allows a two-pixel gap between the oval that represents
that piece and the side of the square.  Since the size of the square is 22 and there
is a 2-pixel gap on each side of the oval, the size of the oval is 22 minus 4, or 18. 
In my program, I defined a method to draw a piece.  Originally, I wrote it as:</p>


<pre>private void drawPiece(GraphicsContext g, int piece, int row, int col) {
   if (piece == WHITE)
      g.setFill(Color.WHITE);
   else
      g.setFill(Color.BLACK);
   g.fillOval(4 + 24*col, 34+24*row, 18, 18);
}</pre>


<p>However, after looking at the result, I decided to outline the white pieces with
black.  That little addition improved the appearance of the game significantly.</p>


<p>The <span class="code">drawBoard()</span> method fills the canvas with light gray,
draws the black lines between the squares, and draws all the pieces that
have been placed on the board. Remember that the piece in a
given row and column is recorded in the <span class="code">board</span> array as
<span class="code">board[row][col]</span>. This is done as follows:</p>


<pre>public void drawBoard() {

    GraphicsContext g = getGraphicsContext2D();
    g.setFill( Color.LIGHTGRAY );  // fill canvas with light gray
    g.fillRect(0,0,314,314);

    /* Draw lines separating the square and along the edges of the canvas.  */

    g.setStroke(Color.BLACK);
    g.setLineWidth(2);
    for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 13; i++) {
        g.strokeLine(1 + 24*i, 0, 1 + 24*i, 314);
        g.strokeLine(0, 1 + 24*i, 314, 1 + 24*i);
    }

    /* Draw the pieces that are on the board. */

    for (int row = 0; row &lt; 13; row++)
        for (int col = 0; col &lt; 13; col++)
            if (boardData[row][col] != EMPTY)
                drawPiece(g, boardData[row][col], row, col);

}  // end drawBoard()</pre>

<p>
<b><u>Playing the Game</u></b>
</p>


<p>The logic of the GoMoku game itself is mostly in the method "<span class="code">void
doClickSquare(int row, int&nbsp;col)</span>", which is called by the
<span class="code">mousePressed()</span> method when the user clicks on the square in row number
<span class="code">row</span> and column number <span class="code">col</span>. This method must check whether the
move is legal. If so, the move is made. The method then checks whether the move
wins the game. If so, the game ends. The game will also end if the board has
become completely full. Otherwise, play passes to the other player.</p>


<p>The current player is recorded in an instance variable named
<span class="code">currentPlayer</span>. The value of this variable is one of the two constants
<span class="code">WHITE</span> or <span class="code">BLACK</span>. The game can be ended by calling a method
named <span class="code">gameOver()</span>. I wrote a <span class="ptype">boolean</span>-valued method called
<span class="code">winner()</span> to check whether a move wins the game. (When I first wrote
this method, it did nothing but "<span class="code">return false</span>". This let me try out
the program at this stage of development, before I started working on the
difficult problem of testing for a winner.) The <span class="code">doClickSquare()</span> method
can be written:</p>


<pre>void doClickSquare(int row, int col) {

    /* Check that the user clicked an empty square.  If not, show an
      error message and exit. */

    if ( boardData[row][col] != EMPTY ) {
        if (currentPlayer == BLACK)
            message.setText("BLACK:  Please click an empty square.");
        else
            message.setText("WHITE:  Please click an empty square.");
        return;
    }

    /* Make the move.  Check if the board is full or if the move
      is a winning move.  If so, the game ends.  If not, then it's
      the other user's turn.  If there is a winner, call
      drawWinLine() to mark the winning pieces. */

    boardData[row][col] = currentPlayer;  // Make the move.
    drawBoard();

    if (winner(row,col)) {  // First, check for a winner.
        if (currentPlayer == WHITE)
            gameOver("WHITE wins the game!");
        else
            gameOver("BLACK wins the game!");
        drawWinLine();
        return;
    }

    boolean emptySpace = false;     // Check if the board is full.
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 13; i++)
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; 13; j++)
            if (boardData[i][j] == EMPTY)
                emptySpace = true;
    if (emptySpace == false) {
        gameOver("The game ends in a draw.");
        return;
    }

    /* Continue the game.  It's the other player's turn. */

    if (currentPlayer == BLACK) {
        currentPlayer = WHITE;
        message.setText("WHITE:  Make your move.");
    }
    else {  
        currentPlayer = BLACK;
        message.setText("BLACK:  Make your move.");
    }

}  // end doClickSquare()</pre>


<p>Note that when the move wins the game, the method <span class="code">drawWinLine()</span> is called.
This will draw a red line through the winning pieces.  Unlike every other part of the
board, the red line is not drawn by <span class="code">drawBoard()</span>.  It is added when the
game is over, and it will stay there until the board is erased at the beginning of the
new game.  Note that this violates my general policy that a <span class="code">draw()</span> method
should completely reflect the state of the game.  In this case, it does not draw
the red line when the state of the game is that the game has been won.  This is OK
only because <span class="code">drawBoard()</span> is never called when the game is in that state.</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>
<b><u>Determining the Winner</u></b>
</p>


<p>The <span class="code">winner()</span> method is certainly the hardest part of the program.
The method must look in each of the four possible directions from the square
where the user has placed a piece. If the player has five or more pieces in a
row in that direction, then the player has won. As indicated in the exercise, a
direction can be indicated by two variables, <span class="code">dirX</span> and <span class="code">dirY</span>.
The values of these variables for each of the four directions are:</p>


<pre>                      dirX    dirY    Why?
                      ----    ----    --------------------------------
horizontal direction    1       0       Only x changes.
vertical direction      0       1       Only y changes.
falling diagonal        1       1       Both x and y change.
rising diagonal         1      -1       Change in opposing directions.</pre>


<p>I wrote a method "<span class="code">int count(int player, int row, int col, int dirX, int
dirY)</span> that counts the number of pieces the specified player has in a row,
starting from the square in row number <span class="code">row</span> and column number
<span class="code">col</span> and looking in the direction indicated by <span class="code">dirX</span> and
<span class="code">dirY</span>. This method contains the code given in the exercise. It returns
the number of pieces found. My <span class="code">winner</span> method just calls this method
for each of the four directions:</p>


<pre>/**
 * This is called just after a piece has been played on the
 * square in the specified row and column.  It determines
 * whether that was a winning move by counting the number
 * of squares in a line in each of the four possible
 * directions from (row,col).  If there are 5 squares (or more)
 * in a row in any direction, then the game is won.
 */
private boolean winner(int row, int col) {
     
   if (count( board[row][col], row, col, 1, 0 ) &gt;= 5)
      return true;
   if (count( board[row][col], row, col, 0, 1 ) &gt;= 5)
      return true;
   if (count( board[row][col], row, col, 1, -1 ) &gt;= 5)
      return true;
   if (count( board[row][col], row, col, 1, 1 ) &gt;= 5)
      return true;
      
   /* When we get to this point, we know that the game is not won. */

   return false;
   
}  // end winner()</pre>


<p>When I first wrote this method, I checked whether the number of pieces was
"<span class="code">== 5</span>" instead of "<span class="code">&gt;= 5</span>". This was a bug. It's possible
for a player to get more than 5 pieces in a row, if the player plays a piece in
an empty square that joins two shorter rows of pieces together.</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>
<b><u>Marking the Winning Pieces</u></b>
</p>


<p>In my program, when a player wins, the row of pieces that wins the game is
marked with a red line. To do this, I added four instance variables of type
<span class="ptype">int</span> to the <span class="classname">Board</span> class. The instance variables are
named <span class="code">win_r1</span>, <span class="code">win_c1</span>, <span class="code">win_r2</span>, and <span class="code">win_c2</span>.
After a player has won the game, the values of these
variables have been set to mark the squares at the two ends of the winning row of
pieces. The positions of these squares are given by <span class="code">(win_r1,win_c1)</span>
and <span class="code">(win_r2,win_c2)</span>.</p>


<p>I added some code to the  <span class="code">count()</span> method to
set the values of these variables. As the <span class="code">count()</span> method
counts the pieces in a line, it sets <span class="code">win_r1</span>, <span class="code">win_c1</span>,
<span class="code">win_r2</span>, and <span class="code">win_c2</span> to mark the location of the last piece it
finds in the two directions it checks.  The values are always set when <span class="code">count()</span>
is called.  If the game is won, this will set the
values correctly.   My program depends on the fact that once it has been determined
that a game has been won, <span class="code">count()</span> will not be called again during that
game.  This means that when <span class="code">drawWinLine()</span> is called, the variables
<span class="code">win_r1</span>, <span class="code">win_c1</span>, <span class="code">win_r2</span>, and <span class="code">win_c2</span>
will still mark the ends of the line of pieces that won the game.
(I'm not really happy about how tricky this is.  My solution is "fragile" in the sense
that it could easily be broken inadvertently if the logic of the program is changed
just a little.  But I really wanted to mark the winning pieces...)</p>
