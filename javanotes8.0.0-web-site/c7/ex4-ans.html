<h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 7.4</h2>
<hr class="break">
<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
           one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="exercise">Exercise 7.4:</h3>
<p>In <a href="../c6/ex2-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;6.2</a>, you wrote a
program <span class="code">DragTwoSquares</span> that allows the user to
drag a red square and a blue square around on a canvas.  Write an
much improved version where the user can add squares to a canvas
and drag them around.  In particular: If the user shift-clicks
or right-clicks the canvas, then the user is trying to drag a
square; find the square that contains the mouse position, if any,
and move it as the user drags the mouse.  Other clicks should
add squares.  You can place the center of the new square at
the current mouse position.  To make the picture more visually
appealing, give each square a random color, and when you draw
the squares, draw a black outline around each square.  (My program
also gives the square a random alpha value between 0.5 and 1.0).</p>

<p>Write a class to represent the data needed for drawing one square,
and use an <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> to store the data for
all the squares in the picture.  If the user drags a square 
completely off the canvas, delete it from the list.</p>

<hr>
<div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
<big><b>Discussion</b></big>
</div>
<hr>

<p>We need three pieces
of information in order to draw a square:  its x-coordinate, its y-coordinate,
and its color.  We can pack the three pieces 
of information into a class:</p>

<pre>/**
 * A class to hold to hold the data for one square.
 */
private static class SquareData {
    double x,y;  // The coordinates of the center of the square.
    Color color; // The color of the square.
    }
}</pre>

<p>The data for the whole collection of squares is then stored using an instance variable
named <span class="code">squares</span> of type <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;SquareData&gt;</span>.
By using an ArrayList, we allow for an unlimited number of squares.</p>


<p>Given this data structure, it's easy to write a <span class="code">draw()</span>
method that completely redraws the contents of the canvas.  
It can use a for-each loop to go through the <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>.  
The loop control
variable, <span class="code">squareData</span>, is of type <span class="classname">SquareData</span>, and 
the data needed to draw the square is given by its three instance variables
<span class="code">squareData.x</span>, <span class="code">squareData.y</span>, and <span class="code">squareData.color</span>.
To draw a rectangle, we need the coordinates of the top-left corner of the square.
Since <span class="code">squareData.x</span> and <span class="code">squareData.y</span> are the coordinates
of the center of the square, we have to subtract half of the square size from
them to get the coordinates for the top-left corner.  In my program, the square size
is 100, so the <span class="code">draw()</span> method can be written as follows:</p>


<pre>private void draw() {
    GraphicsContext g = canvas.getGraphicsContext2D();
    g.setFill(Color.rgb(230,255,230)); // light green background
    g.fillRect(0,0,canvas.getWidth(),canvas.getHeight());
    g.setLineWidth(2);
    g.setStroke(Color.BLACK);
    for ( SquareData squareData: squares ) {
        g.setFill( squareData.color );
        g.fillRect( squareData.x - 50, squareData.y - 50, 100, 100 );
        g.strokeRect( squareData.x - 50, squareData.y - 50, 100, 100 );
    }
}</pre>


<p>This method is called every time the mouse is moved while the user is dragging
a square.  It's not sufficient to draw the square in its new position&mdash;it must
be removed from its previous position, and the area that it previously occupied has to be
redrawn because it might contain other squares.  It is easiest, though not most efficient,
just to redraw the entire picture.  When the user adds a new square, it would be enough
to just draw the new square, but in fact my program just calls <span class="code">draw()</span>
in that case as well.</p>


<p>Another interesting point is in the <span class="code">mousePressed()</span> routine, which
is called by a <span class="code">MousePressed</span> event handler that listens for mouse
events on the canvas.  If the user shift-clicks or right-clicks, we have
to figure out which square contains the mouse position, so that we know which
square to drag.  To do that, we have to search the <span class="classname">ArrayList</span>
of squares to find one that meets the criterion that it contains the mouse
position.  (This is an example of linear search, as defined in <a href="../c7/s4.html#arrays.4.1">Subsection&nbsp;7.4.1</a>.)
There is a twist, since if there are two squares under the mouse, we want the one
that is on top, and that will be the one that comes later in the array.
So, we should search the list starting at the end and working towards the
beginning.  Then the first square that we encounter that contains the mouse
position is the one that we want:</p>


<pre>x = evt.getX();  // (x,y) is the point where the mouse was pressed
y = evt.getY();
for (int i = squares.size() - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {
    SquareData squareData = squares.get(i);
    double cx = squareData.x; // (cx,cy) is the center of the square
    double cy = squareData.y;
    if ( x &gt;= cx - 50 &amp;&amp; x &lt;= cx + 50 &amp;&amp; y &gt;= cy - 50 &amp;&amp; y &lt;= cy + 50) {
        dragging = true;
        draggedSquare = squareData;
        offsetX = x - cx;
        offsetY = y - cy;
        break;  // stop as soon as we find  square containing (x,y)
    }
}</pre>
